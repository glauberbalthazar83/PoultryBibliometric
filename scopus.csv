For livestock and poultry farming, innovative solutions related to feed additives are especially relevant. A valuable phytogenic additive to the feed rations of farm animals and poultry is hydroponic green fodder obtained by germinating seeds. Off-season obtaining of green forage on a hydroponic basis is associated with significant expenditures of thermal and electrical energy, in connection with which the urgent task is to reduce the energy intensity of production. To increase the energy efficiency of green fodder production, it is proposed to create the necessary conditions for the seeds to realize their potential with the help of methods and means of electrical technology, which make it possible to realize ""smart""(controlled) germination and to influence the bioelectric potentials of seeds due to their electrification. As a result of the studies carried out, the maximum charge received by germinating seeds of legumes in the corona discharge field was determined. It was found that the electrification of germinating seeds promotes the activation of growth processes, an increase in the yield and quality of hydroponic green forage, and a decrease in the energy intensity of its production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Additives; Bioelectric potentials; Electric corona; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Industrial robots; Seed; Agro-industrial complex; Corona discharges; Electrical energy; Electrical technology; Electrotechnologies; Germinating seeds; Innovative solutions; Production efficiency; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Ministry of Agriculture of Russia (M.: NRU HSE) Forecast of scientific and technological development of the agro-industrial complex of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2030 140, (2017); Feed and feed additives; Popkov N A, Et al., Feed and biologically active substances, (2005); Ku Y G, Kang D H, Lee C K, Lee S Y, Ryu C S, Kim D E, Polovka M, Namiesnik J, Gorinstein S; Leshchenko G P, Sazonov K A, Leshchenko E A, Dependence of the intensity of electric influence on the stage of spring of seeds, pp. 87-92, (2017); Leshchenko G P, Sazonov K A, Torbeev I G, Electrode systems for processing bio-objects Heat and gas supply for agriculture ed P G Svechnikov, pp. 28-33, (2015); Leshchenko G P, Basarygina E M, Cherepukhina S V, Leshchenko E A, Putilova T A, International Transaction Journal of Engineering, Management, & Applied Sciences & Technologie, (2020); Kruglyakov Yu A, Equipment for the continuous cultivation of green feed hydroponically, (1991); Prokhorov A M, Physical encyclopedic dictionary, (1984); Yavorsky B M, Detlaf A A, Lebedev A K, Physics handbook for engineers and university students, (2008); Leshchenko G P, Improving the efficiency of hydroponic green fodder cultivation by treating germinating seeds in constant electric fields (Chelyabinsk), 192, (2006); Emelyanov A M, Et al., Bureau of Scientific and Technical Information (Yekaterinburg) The use of sapropels in agriculture, (2002); Dospekhov B A, Field experiment technique (with the basics of statistical processing of research results), (2011)","E.M.

Compared to the closed express structured environment for self-driving cars, the agricultural scene is complex and diverse, and its navigation modes and core technologies are also significantly different. In view of this, it is of great value to summarize the development characteristics and trends of autonomous navigation technology in fields, orchards, greenhouses and other scenarios. In this paper, (1) firstly, the types and characteristics of multi-agricultural scenes are analyzed, the principle and mode of agricultural autonomous navigation are expounded, and the agricultural autonomous navigation system and architecture are introduced; (2) secondly, the research status of autonomous navigation technology in open field agriculture, orchard agriculture, facility agriculture, livestock and poultry agriculture and aquatic agriculture is investigated; (3) finally, it is predicted that the differentiated autonomous navigation technology scheme for multi-scene agriculture, multi-dimensional perception, self-understanding navigation technology in agricultural scenarios, selective autonomous navigation technology for task self-matching fusion, the cooperative autonomous navigation technology for multi machine ad hoc network clusters, and the fault self-checking remote diagnosis navigation system are the future research hotspots and development trends. At the same time, it is clear that the in-depth practical application of artificial intelligence, the in-depth research and development of high-precision and low-cost sensors, and the collaborative integration technology of agricultural machinery and agronomy are the critical path to promote the breakthrough of agricultural autonomous navigation technology. The summary and prospect of this paper have positive significance for promoting the overall development of agricultural autonomous navigation technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural autonomous navigation; Agriculture; Differentiated; Scenes","Ad hoc networks; Agricultural robots; Agricultural technology; Orchards; % reductions; Agricultural autonomous navigation; Agricultural labors; Agricultural resources; Autonomous navigation; Development trends; Differentiated; Navigation equipment; Navigation technology; Scene; agricultural labor; agricultural technology; agronomy; artificial intelligence; machinery; navigation; perception; precision; Navigation systems","","","","","Agricultural Equipment of Jiangsu University, (5543000001); Jiangsu Province Key Research and Development Modern Agriculture Key Project, (BE2022363); Project of Faculty of Agricultural Equipment of Jiangsu University, (5541680002); Project of Jiangsu Modern Agricultural Machinery Equipment and Technology Demonstration and Promotion, (1711203004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31971795); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD, (PAPD-2018-87); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (2021RC5025)","This work was supported by the science and technology innovation Program of Hunan Province (2021RC5025), the Jiangsu Province Key Research and Development Modern Agriculture Key Project (BE2022363), the Category I Project of Faculty of Agricultural Equipment of Jiangsu University (5543000001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31971795 ), the Project of Faculty of Agricultural Equipment of Jiangsu University ( 5541680002 ), the Project of Jiangsu Modern Agricultural Machinery Equipment and Technology Demonstration and Promotion (1711203004 ), the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD-2018-87).","Akkamis M., Keskin M., Sekerli Y.E., Comparative appraisal of three low-cost GPS speed sensors with different data update frequencies, AgriEngineering, 3, 2, pp. 423-437, (2021); Altieri M.A., (2003); Andersen N.A., Braithwaite I.D., Blanke M., Sorensen T., Combining a novel computer vision sensor with a cleaning robot to achieve autonomous pig house cleaning, Proceedings of the 44th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, pp. 8331-8336, (2006); Anonymous., Machinery:strong robot arm from Boumatic, Farmers Guardian., (2009); (2010); Bakker T., Asselt K., Bontsema J., Muller J., Straten G., Autonomous navigation using a robot platform in a sugar beet field, Biosyst.

In view of the complexity and particularity of the development of agricultural robot technology, it is of great value to summarize its development characteristics and make reasonable judgments on its development trend. In this paper, the type of agricultural robot systems was first discussed. From the classification of agricultural robot systems, the development of main types of monitoring robots, non-selective and selective working robots for crop farming, livestock and poultry farming and aquaculture were introduced in detail. Then the scientific research, core technology, and commercialization of different types of agricultural robots were summarized. It is believed that navigation in complex agricultural environments, damage-free robot-crop interaction, and agronomy-robot fusion have high scientific value and significance to promote the revolutionary advances in agricultural robot technology. The characteristics of inter-discipline between agricultural robot technology and new materials, artificial intelligence, bionics, agronomy are research focus. The fast damage-free operation, autonomous navigation for complex environments, target detection for complex backgrounds, and special design for agricultural robots are considered to be the key technology of agricultural robot development, and the development path is given. Finally, robot-crop interaction simulation, big data support, and artificial intelligence are regarded as paths to realize the breakthrough of key agricultural robot technologies. The summary and prospect of this paper are of positive significance to promote the overall development of agricultural robot technology. © 2021, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Protein nutrition issues need to be addressed quickly, both in protein production and in rational use. Unbalanced diets for protein inhibits the growth and development of young animals, disrupts metabolism, increases feed consumption per unit of production, thereby increasing its cost. Under these conditions, the use of non-traditional protein feeds of local production and the creation of new recipes for energy-protein concentrates as full-fledged components of compound feeds has become one of the tasks of the Kaliningrad research Institute of agriculture-a branch of the Federal research center all-Russian Institute of feed named after V. R. Williams. The author has been working on the problem of protein deficiency since 2000. She started at the Federal state unitary enterprise ""Novonikolaevskoe""in the Balakovsky district of the Saratov region with scientists from the Department of animal feeding at the Vavilov state agricultural University: doctors of agricultural Sciences Alexander Petrovich Korobov, Sergey Petrovich Moskalenko, Alexey Alekseevich Vasiliev, and continued from 2009 to the present at the Kaliningrad research Institute of agricultural research. The article presents data on feeding calves (2013-2019) and quails (2019) energy-protein concentrate based on extruded grain of narrow-leaved lupine, instead of soy, subjected to heat treatment on a press extruder as part of compound feed; determining the effect of the concentrate on changing the productivity of calves and quails. Calves were fed lupine concentrate with a shell, quails without a shell with the addition of an enzyme preparation. It was found that the feed value of the extruded concentrate based on lupine is not inferior to the extruded concentrate based on soy and allows you to get good gains in live weight of animals and poultry. Concentrate based on lupine, with the addition of enzymes in biological value is equal to full-fat soy.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agricultural robots; Animals; Enzymes; Feeding; Food supply; Heat treatment; Nutrition; Agricultural research; Agricultural science; Biological values; Enzyme preparation; Growth and development; Protein concentrates; Protein production; Research institutes; Grain (agricultural product)","","","","","","","Artyukhov A., Gaponov N., Lupin-a valuable source of protein in compound feeds, pp. 65-66, (2010); Artyukhov A., Vashchekin E., Efimenko E., Kadyrov F., Menkova A., Recommendations for the practical use of feed from narrow-leaved lupine in the diets of farm animals (Bryansk), 55, (2009); Recommendations, (2001); Alekseyev E., Feed lupins: SB, (1959); Kosolapov V.

However, most of the environmental information perception in livestock and poultry houses mostly use multiple fixed collection points, which can only perceive the environmental information of fixed points, so it is difficult to realize the uniform regulation of the environment. The development of Internet of Things technology provides a technical basis for the environmental perception and regulation of livestock and poultry houses, and the development of robot technology provides technical support for the mobile information perception of livestock and poultry houses.

However, serious pressure has been put on the rural agriculture communities as a consequence of the urbanization. In addition, the lack of using efficient processes has hindered the development of both the agriculture and poultry sectors. One possible solution to address this issue is the Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based smart management system in order to introduce modernization in traditional methods. This chapter will begin with the examination of the challenges faced by the conventional agriculture and poultry farm followed by possible contributions of IoT-based technologies and solutions to improve quality, quantity, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of agricultural and poultry sectors. Then, the enablement of intelligent control and real-time decision-making by applying state-of-the-art methodologies comprising sensors for monitoring, and drones for maintaining surveillance and detecting irregularities through image analysis is discussed. The major contribution of this chapter is to elucidate the system design for monitoring various environmental parameters regarding smart agriculture and poultry farms by using wireless sensor networks and artificial intelligence. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agriculture;

However, the measurement of concentrations of airborne pollutants in livestock buildings is generally quite difficult. To counter this, the development of an autonomous robot that could collect key environmental data continuously in livestock buildings was initiated. This research presents a specific part of the larger study that focused on the preliminary laboratory test for evaluating the navigation precision of the robot being developed under the different ground surface conditions and different localization algorithm according internal sensors. The construction of the robot was such that each wheel of the robot was driven by an independent DC motor with four odometers fixed on each motor. The inertial measurement unit (IMU) was rigidly fixed on the robot vehicle platform. The research focused on using the internal sensors to calculate the robot position (x, y, θ) through three different methods. The first method relied only on odometer dead reckoning (ODR), the second method was the combination of odometer and gyroscope data dead reckoning (OGDR) and the last method was based on Kalman filter data fusion algorithm (KFDF). A series of tests were completed to generate the robot’s trajectory and analyse the localisation accuracy. These tests were conducted on different types of surfaces and path profiles. The results proved that the ODR calculation of the position of the robot is inaccurate due to the cumulative errors and the large deviation of the heading angle estimate. However, improved use of the gyroscope data of the IMU sensor improved the accuracy of the robot heading angle estimate. The KFDF calculation resulted in a better heading angle estimate than the ODR or OGDR calculations. The ground type was also found to be an influencing factor of localisation errors. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In such application settings, the robots initially search and explore the entire workspace to find the targets, so that the subsequent robots conveniently move directly to the targets to fulfill the task. A multi-layer robot navigation system is necessary for SLR operations. The scenario of interest is the removal of broiler mortality by autonomous robots in poultry barns in this paper. Daily manual collection of broiler mortality is time-and labor-consuming, and an autonomous robotic system can solve this issue effectively. In this paper, a multi-layer navigation system is developed to detect and remove broiler mortality with two robots. One robot is assigned to search a large-scale workspace in a coverage mode and find and locate objects, whereas the second robot directly moves to the located targets to remove the objects. Directed coverage path planning (DCPP) fused with an informative planning protocol (IPP) is proposed to efficiently search the entire workspace. IPP is proposed for coverage directions in DCPP devoted to rapidly achieving spatial coverage with the least estimation uncertainty in the decomposed grids. The detection robot consists of a developed informative-based directed coverage path planner and a You Only Look Once (YOLO) V4-based dead bird detector. It refines and optimizes the coverage path based on historical data on broiler mortality distribution in a broiler barn. The removal robot collects dead broilers driven by a new hub-based multi-target path routing (HMTR) scheme, which is applicable to row-based environments. The proposed methods show great potential to navigate in broiler barns ef-ficiently and safely, thus being a useful component for robotics. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods are validated through simulation and comparison studies. © The Author(s) 2022.","broiler mortality; Directed coverage path planning; hub-based multi-target routing (HMTR) scheme;

A class of irregular objects with articulated components that have motions with scales that are several orders of magnitude larger than each component's localized deformations is considered. Biomaterials with internal skeletal structures (such as bird carcasses in the poultry industry) fall into this category. A methodology is described in that models such objects as a number of joint-connected rigid bodies. As part of the larger bin-picking and subsequent manipulation task, a robot end-effector is assumed to have firmly grasped one connected body (such as a bird wing) during singulation. The manner of grasping is assumed detectable. It is developed and then demonstrated through dynamics simulation and experiments that desired motion control of the distal connected components is possible through proper dynamic manipulation of the grasped (proximal) component. The proper manipulation of the grasped component is computed through a learning process. © 2016 IEEE.","deformable objects; motion control; robotic manipulation","Bins; Birds; Deformation; End effectors; Intelligent mechatronics; Motion control; Rigid structures; Connected component; Deformable object; Dynamics simulation; Localized deformations; Orders of magnitude; Robot end effector; Robotic manipulation; Skeletal structures; Robotics","","","","","","","Miyamoto H., Schaal S., Gandolfo F., Gomi H., Koike Y., Osu R., Nakano E., Wada Y., Kawato M., A kendama learning robot based on bi-directional theory, Neural Networks, 9, pp. 1281-1302, (1996); Hashimoto K., Noritsugu T., Modeling and control of robotic yo-yo with visual feedback, International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2650-2655, (1996); Arisumi H., Komoriya K., Catching motion of casting manipulation, International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 2351-2357, (2000); Nohmi M., Nenchev D.N., Uchiyama M., Tethered robot casting using a spacecraft-mounted manipulator, Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics, 24, pp. 827-833, (2001); Press W.H., Teukolsky S.A., Vetterling W.T., Flannery B.P., Numerical Recipes in C, (1992)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2016 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics, AIM 2016","12 July 2016 through 15 July 2016","Banff","124072","","978-150902065-2","","","English","IEEE ASME Int Conf Adv Intellig Mechatron AIM","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992437402"

The conventional method of feeding poultry requires poultry to be fed continuously and it increases human workforce to ensure the poultry is fed in correct period of time. This project is related to the development of a poultry feeder system using line follower robot. The aim of this project is to automatically feed poultry at a given period of time and to alert user when the feeds are running out of supply. This project is using line-following robot as the main concept to distribute food. This robot feeder is operated by moving around the barn by tracking lines on the barn floor. Therefore, the proposed method is more efficient than manual conventional way of feeding because less effort will be needed in feeding the chickens and less feeds will be wasted. In this work, the detail design of the robot is described and preliminary experiment to show the usefulness of the propose system is reported. © 2020 Malaysian Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences.

Nutrient run-off from agriculture, poultry farms, and other anthropogenic influences are threatening the health of the Assateague and other coastal bays of the Delmarva Peninsula. While manned boats can be navigated in certain areas of the bay, many locations important for environmental and other scientific studies are too shallow or spatially constrained to be accessed by large boats or accessed by foot from the shore. The AIRSPACES project is directed by faculty in engineering and environmental sciences at UMES and involves a multidisciplinary team of students to design and utilize innovative remote controlled and/or autonomous air-propelled, small-scale (less than 1.5m in length) aquatic platforms instrumented with various sensors including GPS, depth, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and nitrate to measure the geo-located water quality parameters in the Assateague Bay and other water bodies. Sensory platforms such as CAUTION that are being developed by the project team not only provide an innovative and challenging learning framework for the students but also contribute to a critical need in the region. An exchange student from the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP) who was supported by an MDSGC scholarship, has so far led the CAUTION efforts with support from UMES students. In this paper, we report novel features of the platform and preliminary trials with data collection runs in remote-controlled and autonomous mode. All spatial and water quality related sensory data are recorded to a memory card on the boat for subsequent data analysis and mapping efforts. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.","","","","","","","","","Karr J.R., Dudley D.R., Ecological perspective on water quality goals, Environmental Management, 1, 1, pp. 55-68; Bricker S.B., Ferreira J.G., Simas T., An integrated methodology for assessment of estuarine trophic status, Ecological Modeling, 169, 1, pp. 39-60, (2003); Nagchaudhuri A., Mitra M., Zhang L., AIRSPACES: Air-propelled instrumented robotic sensory platform(s) for assateague coastline environmental studies - A multidisciplinary experiential learning and research project at minority serving land grant institution, Proceedings of 2013 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 1623-1625, (2013); Diab M., Uche E., Dyab M., Nagchaudhuri A., SAMPLE: A small autonomous monitoring platform for lakes and estuaries, Proceedings of 2014 Annual Conference of American Society for Engineering Education, (2014)","","","American Society for Engineering Education","","2015 122nd ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition","14 June 2015 through 17 June 2015","Seattle","113020","21535965","","","","English","ASEE Annu.

This paper presents the 'GRIBBOT' - a novel 3D vision-guided robotic concept for front half chicken harvesting. It functions using a compliant multifunctional gripper tool that grasps and holds the fillet, scrapes the carcass, and releases the fillet using a downward pulling motion. The gripper has two main components; a beak and a supporting plate. The beak scrapes the fillet down the rib cage of the carcass following a path determined by the anatomical boundary between the meat and the bone of the rib cage. The supporting plate is actuated pneumatically in order to hold the fillet. A computer vision algorithm was developed to process images from an RGB-D camera (Kinect v2) and locate the grasping point in 3D as the initial contact point of the gripper with the chicken carcass for harvesting operation. Calibration of camera and robot was performed so that the grasping point was defined using 3D coordinates within the robot's base coordinate frame and tool centre point. A feed-forward Look-and-Move control algorithm was used to control the robot arm and generate the motion trajectories, based on the 3D coordinates of the grasping point as calculated from the computer vision algorithm. The results of an experimental proof-of-concept demonstration showed that GRIBBOT was successful both in scraping the carcass, grasping chicken fillets automatically and in completing the front half fillet harvesting process. It demonstrated a potential for the flexible robotic automation of the chicken fillet harvesting operation. Its commercial application, with further development, can result in automated fillet harvesting, while future research may also lead to optimal raw material utilisation. GRIBBOT shows that there is potential to automate even the most challenging processing operations currently carried out manually by human operators. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Chicken; Flexible automation; Gripper; Harvesting; Robot; Visual servoing","Norway; Algorithms; Animals; Automation; Cameras; Grippers; Harvesting; Robotics; Robots; Visual servoing; Chicken; Commercial applications; Computer vision algorithms; Flexible automation; Harvesting operations; Initial contact point; Processing operations; Production efficiency; algorithm; bone; calibration; computer vision; coordinate; harvesting; image analysis; meat; performance assessment; poultry; research work; robotics; Computer vision","","","","","The Research Council of Norway, (225349/E40)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by The Research Council of Norway as part of the CYCLE ( http://cycleweb.no/ ) research project (225349/E40).

Poultry farmers frequently have to overcome extreme environmental conditions to maintain their chickens' wellbeing. Prior research has proposed automating poultry farming activities to control environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity). However, these interventions have never been implemented, in this context, to understand how they would work and participants' perceptions. Further, chicken coops in SSA have different configurations that would make technology automation difficult. To explore how technology can be used to address this problem, we worked with local collaborators to design and deploy ""NkhukuProbe""- a low-cost sensor-based technology that poultry farmers can interact with via USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) to monitor and adjust chicken coop conditions. First, we conducted a review of related work on poultry farming in SSA and a pilot study with poultry farming experts. Findings from this work guided the design of NkhukuProbe. Then, we deployed NkhukuProbe in 15 Malawian households for one month. The goals of our deployment were to understand participants' experiences using NkhukuProbe and to learn about other ways of using sensors in this context. To achieve these goals, we used interview, diary, observation and data logging to collect data throughout the deployment. Our findings suggest that a technology probe's approach unveiled different opportunities for using sensors to support poultry farming in SSA. Further, NkhukuProbe motivated participants to think of other ways of using sensors. We present design implications based on these findings and offer new perspectives on the role of technology in supporting poultry farming activities. © 2021 ACM.","Domestic technology; Malawi; Poultry; Sensors","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Animals; Data acquisition; Probes; Domestic technology; Environmental conditions; Farming activities; Income generating activities; Low-cost sensors; Malawi; Sub-Saharan; Supplementary services; Temperature and humidities; Wellbeing; Humidity control","","","","","Mary Louise Gephart; Midwestern State University, MSU","The authors are grateful to respondents, local technicians, and research assistants for their time.

To saturate the domestic market with high-quality foodstuffs, intensification of agricultural production is required through technological modernization of the agricultural sector of the economy and the introduction of modern resource-saving technologies. The growth of food production requires planning a mechanism for the production waste management, so this issue is very relevant for many manufacturers in connection with the tightening of environmental requirements in many countries. Several promising technologies for the entomologically poultry waste management, which provide complete protein for feeding farm animals and therefore increase the profitability of production, are discussed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Animals; Biotechnology; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Manufacture; Proteins; Agricultural productions; Agricultural sector; Environmental burdens; Environmental requirement; Industrial production; Renewable sources; Resource-saving technologies; Technological modernization; Waste management","","","","","","","Yu K.O., Marinchenko T.E., The relevance of effective feed production, Agrarian Bulletin of the South-East, 2, pp. 44-46, (2018); Bandara N., Chalamaiah M., Bioactives from Agricultural Processing By-products Encyclopedia of Food Chemistry, pp. 472-480, (2019); FAO Food Wastage Footprint: Impact on Natural Resources Summary Report; Wadhwa M., Bakshi M.P.S., Application of Waste-Derived Proteins in the Animal Feed Industry, 10, pp. 161-192, (2016); Adegbeye M.J., Ravi Kanth Reddy P., Obaisi A.I., Elghandour M.M.M.Y., Oyebamiji K.J., Salem A.Z.M., Morakinyo-Fasipe O.T., Cipriano-Salazar M., Camacho-Diaz L.M., Sustainable agriculture options for production, greenhouse gasses and pollution alleviation, and nutrient recycling in emerging and transitional nations, Journal of Cleaner Production, 242, (2020); Gasco L., Biasato I., Dabbou S., Schiavone A., Gai F., Animals Fed Insect-based Diets: State-of-the-art on Digestibility, Performance and Product Quality Animals, 9, pp. 170-202, (2019); Saleeva I.P., Sklyar A.V., Marinchenko T.E., Postnova M.V., Ivanov A.V., Tikhomirov A.I., E3S Web of Conferences, (2019); Report on the Environmental Development of the Russian Federation for Future Generations, (2016); Leip A., Et al., The value of manure-Manure as co-product in life cycle assessment, Journal of Environmental Management, 241, pp. 293-304, (2019); Popov V.N., Korneeva O.S., Yu I.O., Yu I.A., Innovative methods of poultry farming biowaste processing, Bulletin of the Voronezh State University of Engineering Technologies, 821, pp. 194-200, (2020); Arnold Van Huis A., Oonincx D.G.A.B., The environmental sustainability of insects as food and feed Agron, Sustain.

In this paper, we present the implementation of an autonomous mobile robot developed by the authors to study group behaviour of chicks of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). We discuss the design of the robot and of the experimental framework that we built to run animal–robot experiments. The robot design was experimentally validated, we demonstrated that the robot can be socially integrated into animal groups. The designed system extends the current state of the art in the field of animal–robot interaction in general and the birds study in particular by combining such advantages as (1) the robot being a part of the group, (2) the possibility of mixed multi-robot, multi-animal groups, and (3) close-loop control of robots. It opens new opportunities in the study of behaviour in domestic fowl by using mobile robots; being socially integrated into the animal group, robots can profit from the positive feedback mechanism that plays key roles in animal collective behaviour. They have potential applications in various domains, from pure scientific research to applied areas such as control and ensuring welfare of poultry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Animal–robot interaction; Autonomous mobile robots; Collective animal behaviour; Sound localisation; Visual tracking","Animals; Feedback; Mobile robots; Navigation; Animal behaviour; Autonomous Mobile Robot; Localisation; Robot interactions; Visual Tracking; Machine design","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (112150, 122148)","The authors would like to thank the Swiss National Science Foundation grant No. 112150 and 122148 “Mixed society of robots and vertebrates” for the support of this work.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the operation of robots in a poultry grow-out house environment is feasible from an animal behavior perspective. To determine this, an experiment was conducted operating both an aerial and a ground robot in a small-scale grow-out house housing broiler chickens for a typical growth cycle (6 weeks). Humans also interacted with the flock daily. The environment and robots were equipped with cameras and other sensors to record data for the entire duration of the experiment. As a part of this research effort, the team had to establish a set of measurable metrics with which to be able to quantify changes in animal behavior. Given the unique scenario and data collection abilities, a set of three measurable metrics with which to quantitatively assess the impact of operating the robots was created. These metrics included avoidance distance, speed when avoiding, and recovery time. Each of the newly defined metrics can be evaluated using statistics and mathematical analysis. As a result, a software program was developed to assist in the analysis of these metrics. The avoidance distance metric is defined as the average distance between the chicken and the external stimuli, whether it be humans or the robot systems, as it moves throughout the house. The flight response metric is defined as the animal response running away from external stimuli. The mass of movement, their average speed, and distance of travel can all be quantitatively characterized. Finally, the recovery time metric is defined as the average time it takes before the chicken resume ""normal"" activity after the stimulus leaves the environment. A software tool was developed to assist in the analysis of these metrics using video recordings. The analysis shows that there are statistical differences in the average avoidance distance metric but there is no significant difference between the average speeds, or with the recovery time metric, indicating that operating robots in the environment is no more stressful to the chicken than the presence of a human. A study on the ability of these metrics for identifying statistically significant changes in animal behavior and what they potentially mean is presented herein.

Attempts to maximize the amount of coconut meal included in the broiler feed have been made through amino acids supplementation, enzyme addition and pelleting coconut meal. Among these feed technologies and manipulation, pelleting coconut meal appears to be more powerful in promoting the growth of broiler chickens. The reasons for the improvement of broiler growth due to pelleting coconut meal have not been established yet. The mechanisms of improved growth of birds might be through increased feed intake, less energy spent and increased bulk density. Coconut meal contains a high concentration of mannose - based polysaccharides or mannan. This substance has long been believed to have prebiotic properties due to its capability to bind certain species of pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tract of birds. Voluminous reports of the positive effects of mannose-based polysaccharides from yeast have been published. Mannose -based polysaccharides from legumes, on the other hand, have been reported to have anti-nutrient property. Surprisingly, mannose-based polysaccharides from coconut behave like yeast mannan. A number of current studies indicated that mannose based polysaccharides improved body weight gain and feed digestibility. The growth of birds was negatively impacted when the birds were challenged against pathogenic bacteria of E. coli. Wet droppings and diarrhea incidences were not found in E. coli-challenged birds when the diets were supplemented with coconut mannan. In conclusions, coconut meal can be used as a feed ingredient for poultry unless the coconut meal was pelleted or enzymatically treated. Mannose-based polysaccharide from coconut was effective to promote growth and acted as prebiotic. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Birds; Escherichia coli; Nutrition; Pelletizing; Yeast; Agricultural by-products; Broiler chickens; Broiler feeds; Digestive tract; Feed ingredients; Fibre content; Low qualities; Pathogenic bacterium; Polysaccharides","","","","","","","Faostat Agriculture Data, (2017); Sundu B., Hatta U., Chaudhry A.S., Potential use of beta mannan from copra meal as a feed additive for broilers, Worlds Poult.

In this study, floodwater samples (n = 96) were collected as promptly post-hurricane as possible and for up to approximately 30 days and selectively enriched for Campylobacter using Bolton broth enrichment and isolation on modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA) microaero-bically at 42°C. Only one sample yielded Campylobacter, which was found to be Campylobacter jejuni with the novel sequence type 2866 (ST-2866). However, the methods employed to isolate Campylobacter readily yielded Arcobacter from 73.5% of the floodwater samples. The Arcobacter isolates failed to grow on Mueller-Hinton agar at 25, 30, 37, or 42°C microaerobically or aerobically but could be readily sub-cultured on mCCDA at 42°C microaerobically. Multilocus sequence typing of 112 iso-lates indicated that all were Arcobacter butzleri. The majority (85.7%) of the isolates exhibited novel sequence types (STs), with 66 novel STs identified. Several STs, in-cluding certain novel ones, were detected in diverse waterbody types (channel, iso-lated ephemeral pools, floodplain) and from multiple watersheds, suggesting the po-tential for regionally dominant strains. The genotypes were clearly partitioned into two major clades, one with high representation of human and ruminant isolates and another with an abundance of swine and poultry isolates. Surveillance of environ-mental waters and food animal production systems in this animal agriculture-dense region is needed to assess potential regional prevalence and temporal stability of the observed A. butzleri strains as well as their potential association with specific types of food animal production. © 2020 Niedermeyer et al","","Arcobacter; Campylobacter jejuni; Cyclonic Storms; Floods; Genotype; Multilocus Sequence Typing; North Carolina; Rivers; North Carolina; United States; Arcobacter; Arcobacter butzleri; Campylobacter; Campylobacter jejuni; environmental samples (Arcobacter); Rosa carolina carolina; Ruminantia; Agricultural robots; Algae; Bacteria; Charcoal; Floods; Hurricanes; Polysaccharides; Animal agriculture; Campylobacter jejuni; Campylobacter spp; Ephemeral pools; Genetic diversity; Multilocus sequence typing; North Carolina , USA; Temporal stability; agar; bacterium; charcoal; concentration (composition); flooding; genetic analysis; genotype; microbial activity; Arcobacter; Campylobacter jejuni; flooding; genetics; genotype; hurricane; isolation and purification; microbiology; multilocus sequence typing; North Carolina; river; Animals","","","","","Department of Food, Nutrition and Bioprocessing Sciences at North Carolina State University; North America Food Microbiology Committee; North Carolina State University's Hur-ricane Florence Recovery Effort Travel Fund; North Carolina State University’s Hurricane Florence Recovery Effort Travel Fund; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CBET-1901588); International Life Sciences Institute, ILSI; College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Arizona, CALS, UA; nonprofit science foundation","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) North America Food Microbiology Committee.

The poultry meat branch was chosen as the object of research. This is one of the most dynamically developing sectors of agriculture in Russia Modified localization coefficients were used as a method for detecting the territorial concentration of the sector. The analysis showed that more than half of the output of poultry meat products was concentrated in the territory of 12 regions of Russia The largest localization of poultry farming is in the center of the European part of the country, near large cities. The level of territorial concentration of the poultry meat sector increased significantly over the period of 2004-2017. The localization coefficients of the regions that specialize in poultry meat production have more than doubled. There is an increase in ""polarity"" in the specialization of regions. Some regions continue to increase the production of poultry meat, the level of regional specialization is growing. In other regions, poultry production is declining. Taking the poultry meat sector as a case study, it has been shown that the processes of regional specialization and territorial localization are increasing in Russian agriculture. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Large cities; Poultry meat; Poultry production; Poultry sector; Meats","","","","","","","Uzun V., Shagaida N., Lerman Z., Russian agriculture: Growth and institutional challenges, Land Use Policy, 83, pp. 475-487, (2019); Kostenko O., Modified localization coefficients for cluster processes identification: A comparative analysis (case study: The Russian rye sector), International Conference on Efficient Production and Processing (ICEPP-2020) E3S Web Conf., 161, (2020); Carayannis E., Grigoroudis E., Quadruple innovation helix and smart specialization: Knowledge production and national competitiveness, Foresight and STI Governance, 10, 1, pp. 31-42, (2016); Bosch A., Vonortas N., Smart specialization as a tool to foster innovation in emerging economies: Lessons from Brazil, Foresight and STI Governance, 13, 1, pp. 32-47, (2019); Kutsenko E., Islankina E., Kindras A., Smart by oneself an analysis of Russian regional innovation, Strategies Within the RIS3 Framework, Foresight and STI Governance, 12, 1, pp. 25-45, (2018); Long C., Zhang X., Patterns of China's industrialization: Concentration, specialization, and clustering, China Economic Review, 23, 3, pp. 593-612, (2012); Michler J.D., Agriculture in the process of development: A micro-perspective, World Development, 129, (2020); Pachoud C., Labeyrie V., Polge E., Collective action in localized agrifood systems: An analysis by the social networks and the proximities. study of a serrano cheese producers' association in the campos de cima da serra/ Brazil, Journal of Rural Studies, 9, pp. 58-74, (2019); Lamine C., Garcon L., Brunori G., Territorial agrifood systems: A Franco-Italian contribution to the debates over alternative food networks in rural areas, Journal of Rural Studies, 68, pp. 159-170, (2019); Abson D.J., Chapter 19: The Economic Drivers and Consequences of Agricultural Specialization, Agroecosystem Diversity, pp. 301-315, (2019); Kemeny T., Storper M., Is specialization good for regional economic development, Regional Studies, 49, 6, pp. 1003-1018, (2015); Rastvortseva S.N., Ternovskii D.S., Driver of concentration of economic activity in Russia's regions, Economic and Social Changes: Facts, Trends, Forecast, 2, pp. 153-170, (2016); Grebenkin I., Trends in industrial specializations and development dynamics in the Russian regions, Economics of Region, 16, pp. 69-83, (2020); Antonyuk V.S., Vansovich E.R., Lapo A.S., Transformation in industrial specialization and feature of economic development across the subjects of the Russian federation, Journal of New Economy, 21, 1, pp. 72-88, (2020); Lyubimov I.L., Ospanova A.G., How to make an economy more complex the determinants of complexity in historical perspective, Voprosy Ekonomiki, 2, pp. 36-53, (2019); Kutsenko E., Eferin Y., Whirlpools"" and ""safe harbors"" in the dynamics of industrial specialization in Russian regions, Foresight and STI Governance, 13, 3, pp. 24-40, (2019)","O.

A huge number of different systems are developed and used in agricultural industries. In this paper, we consider a control system for small poultry farms. In the developed system, it is planned to realize the ability to control the ammonia content and display the current concentration readings, to implement data transfer to a remote user.

In this context, motion, slip, and tractive efficiency of the robots were compared based on the Student's t-test for tire air pressure of 20.68–55.16 kPa and robot forward speed of 0.17–0.5 m/s. Results indicate that motion efficiency of the tracked robot (93.27–95.12%) was lower than that of the wheeled robot (94.52–99.31%) with normal and maximum tire air pressure. Moreover, slip efficiency of the tracked robot (89.25–91.73%) was higher than that of the wheeled robot (80.94–89.74%) in all drawbar works. Tractive efficiency of the tracked robot (83.02–87.10%) was also higher than that of the wheeled robot (80.17–84.60%) in almost all drawbar works. Thus, it can be pointed out that the tracked robot outperformed than the wheeled robot in term of traction performance. Generally, numerical and analytical descriptions are applicable for the researchers interested in improvement and optimization of locomotion system performance of ground mobile robots in agricultural drawbar works. This type of the robots is commonly employed in agricultural environments such as field, livestock, poultry house, and greenhouse. © 2022 The Authors","Motion efficiency; Slip efficiency; Tracked robot; Tractive efficiency; Wheeled robot","","","","","","Zagros Sanat Arka Company, (2021-2022, 99-7957154)","Two skid-steering tractor robots (wheeled and tracked robots) were utilized in this study.

Precision landing control of UAV is critical for application of it in some specific areas such as greenhouses or livestock/poultry houses. For controlling UAV landing on a fixed or mobile apron/platform accurately, this study proposed an automatic method and tested it under three scenarios: (1) UAV landing at high operating altitude based on the GPS signal of the mobile apron; (2) UAV landing at low operating altitude based on the image recognition on the mobile apron; and (3) UAV landing progress control based on the fixed landing device and image detection to achieve a stable landing action. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method, apron at both stationary and mobile (e.g., 3 km/h moving speed) statuses were tested. Besides, a simulation was conducted for the UAV landing on a fixed apron by using a commercial poultry house as a model (135 L × 15 W × 3 H m). Results show that the average landing errors in high altitude and low altitude can be controlled within 6.78 cm and 13.29 cm, respectively. For the poultry house simulation, the landing errors were 6.22 ± 2.59 cm, 6.79 ± 3.26 cm, and 7.14 ± 2.41cm at the running speed of 2 km/h, 3 km/h, and 4 km/h, respectively. This study provides the basis for applying the UAV in agricultural facilities such as poultry or animal houses where requires a stricter landing control than open fields. © 2020 by the authors.

Between 1993 and 2013, for example, the Indonesian broiler industry was the sixth-fastest growing in the world. The aim of this article is to identify the Indonesia's broilers business facing with oversupply difficulties and its evolution. Methods of information and data analyzes were descriptive, analytical or assessment based on evidence from the existing condition of the Indonesia's broilers business and its evolution. Indonesia's poultry sector continues to demonstrate strong growth, despite industry reports of oversupply. The government has taken some efforts to regulate the import of breeder stock in order to slow growth and strengthen prices, although the results are negligible. According to the survey conducted by Ministry of Agriculture based on monitoring of Market Information Service on June 25, 2019, the average price per kg live bird (LB) in the National is IDR 20,216, while the average price on Java Island is around IDR 11,327, and LB prices in Central Java and East Java are only around IDR 8,845 and IDR 10,736. The fall in the price of broilers meat in Java, due to not all of meat produced is absorbed in traditional markets. This situation occurs because the broiler farmers predicts there will be an increase in demand after period of Eid al-Fitr celebration, it turned out that such conditions did not occur so the product becomes abundant and finally the price down. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Animals; Commerce; Costs; Facings; Information services; Broiler industry; Indonesia; Poultry meat; Poultry sector; Slow growth; Strong growth; Traditional markets; Meats","","","","","","","Ministry Of Trade I., Kajian Kebijakan Persaingan Usaha di Sektor Perunggasan.

In terms of recognition algorithm, firstly, Otsu algorithm is used to segment chickens from the background, then open operation is used to remove some small noise areas, and finally the maximum temperature of the remaining area is extracted to determine whether there are dead chickens in the cage. In the aspect of hardware design, through the function analysis of the robot, the main hardware selection and system development are completed. The dead chicken detection test was carried out on the dead chicken identification robot system. The results showed that the identification rate of dead chicken in the upper coop was 83. 0%, the identification rate of dead chicken in the lower coop was 77. 0%, and the overall recognition rate was 80. 0%. © 2023 Journal of Chinese Agricultural Mechanization Editorial Office.

As disasters, health, and infectious disease become part of planning concern (Matthew & McDonald, 2007), greater focus on household infrastructure and EID disease outbreaks among poultry is warranted. Following Spencer (2013), this study examines the relationship between the mix of household-scale water supplies, sanitation systems, and construction materials, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among poultry in a developing country: Vietnam. Findings of our multivariate logistic regressions suggest that a non-linear, Kuznets-shaped urban transition (Spencer, 2013) has an independent effect on the outbreak of HPAI, especially as it relates to household-level sanitation infrastructure. We conclude that the Kuznets-shape development of household infrastructure characteristics in Vietnam play a significant role in explaining where poultry outbreaks occur. Using secondary data from the Census of Population and Housing, and the Agricultural Census at the District and Commune levels for the country of Vietnam, we performed logistic regression to test the relationship between outbreaks of HPAI in poultry and newly-developed “coherence indices” (Spencer, 2013) of household water supply, sanitation, and construction materials that measure nonlinear, transitional development. Results show that district-scale coherence indices are negatively and independently correlated with HPAI outbreaks, especially for sanitation. Findings also suggest that community-scale coherence of urban infrastructures is a powerful tool for predicting where HPAI poultry outbreaks are likely to occur, thereby providing health planners new tools for efficient surveillance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Avian influenza; Coherence index; Emerging infectious disease; Household infrastructure; The built landscape; Urban transition; Viet Nam","Viet Nam; Animalia; Aves; Agricultural robots; Developing countries; Logistic regression; Population statistics; Sanitation; Surveys; Water supply; Avian influenza; Emerging infectious disease; Household infrastructure; The built landscape; Urban transition; Viet Nam; avian influenza; developing world; index method; infectious disease; infrastructure; poultry; regression analysis; sanitation; urban planning; Diseases","","","","","Ha Noi University of Agriculture; National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Biological Sciences, BIO, (0909410)","The data discussed here were made possible by National Science Foundation grant # 0909410 , under the Coupled Human-Natural Systems Program and facilitated through close collaboration with Viet Nam’s Ha Noi University of Agriculture.

As a result provision of optimal conditions to all birds is difficult to assess and even more difficult to achieve. An autonomous roving sensor platform would be an ideal solution to provide these data at a high-density grid for the entire building. This feasibility study has clearly shown that a robot sensor platform can navigate through a flock of broilers during the majority of the growing cycle even on days with maximum stocking density. The 2dimensional environmental data collected for the building, clearly make the case for using the robot to assess the uniformity of the climate conditions at any location and time thus providing a real-time opportunity to improve the climate conditions experienced by the flock of broiler birds. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The poultry viscera were grabbed by the manipulation with the guidance of machine vision technology. A machine-vision-based method of locating the viscera of poultry carcasses was described. The threshold segmentation method, sobel operator and image operations were used to segment the images of poultry viscera. Subsequently, the visceral contour was extracted and its position was detected for common poultry such as Three-Yellow Chicken. The identification rates of this visceral contour recognition system were 95.3%, suggesting that the proposed image recognition algorithm could achieve the accuracy required for poultry visceral contour detection. Therefore, the traditional artificial poultry eviscerating would be replaced by robot eviscerating technology, and the new technology exhibited higher automation program and better eviscerated effect, the location prediction of viscera and the positioning of the machine vision system could be designed, the new technical means were provided for subsequent research on the conveyor chain of poultry eviscerated. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Automation; Engineering education; Image recognition; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Manufacture; Robots; Contour detection; Identification rates; Location prediction; Machine vision systems; Machine vision technologies; Recognition algorithm; Recognition systems; Threshold segmentation; Computer vision","","","","","Year Science and technology research project of Hubei education department","This work was supported by the 2015 Year Youth Foundation of Wuhan Donghu University and 2016 Year Science and technology research project of Hubei education department.","Ying Y., Rao X., Ma J., Methodology for nondestructive in spection of citrus maturity with machine vision[J], Transaction of the CSAE, 20, pp. 144-147, (2004); Zhang F., Zhang X., Zhao D., Et al., External quality detection of apples using image processing technology[J], Journal of China Agricultural University, 11, pp. 96-99, (2006); Zhan H., Li X., Wang W., Et al., Determination of chestnuts grading based on machine vision[J], Transaction of the CSAE, 26, pp. 327-331, (2010); Ingrid P., Eddie S., Shape characterization of new apple cultivars by flourier expansion of digitized images[J], J Agric Engng Res, 72, 2, pp. 113-118, (1999); Blasco J., Aleixos N., Molto'E, Computer vision detection of peel defects in citrus by means of a region oriented segmentation algorithm[J], Journal of Food Engineering, 81, 3, pp. 535-543, (2007); Kondo N., Automation on fruit and vegetable grading system and food traceability[J], Trends in Food Science&Technology, 21, 3, pp. 115-145, (2010); Ronghua J., Daoliang L., Lairong C., Et al., Classification and identification of foreign fibers in cotton on the basis of a support vector machine[J], Mathematical and Computer Modeling, 51, 11-12, pp. 1433-1437, (2010); Qu X., Ding T., A fast feature extraction algorithm for detection of foreign fiber in lint cotton within a complex background[J], Acta Automatica Sinica, 6, pp. 785-790, (2010); Richard S., Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications [M], (2010); Gharavi-Alkhansari M., A Fast Globally Optimal Algorithm for Template Matching Using Low-resolution Pruning[J], IEEE Transactions on Image Process, 10, 4, pp. 526-533, (1996); Lee S.W., Kim W.Y., Rotation-invariant Template Matching Using Projection Method[J], Proc.KIT, 19, pp. 475-476; Milan S., Vaclav H., Roger B., Image Processing, Analysis and Machine Vision, (1999); Torben B., A Method and An Apparatus for Evisceration of Poultry: DK, WO, (2009); Ma P.W., Wang L., Ye J., Wang Z., The domestic application prospects of automatic evisceration technology, Academic Periodical of Farm Products Processing and Equipment of Slaughtered Poultry, 10, pp. 93-95, (2009); Zhangk B., Design on live area of poultry slaughtering and processing, Meatind., 3, pp. 2-6, (2012); Ma P.W., Wang L.H., Ye J.P., Wang Z.K., The domestic application prospects of automatic evisceration technology and equipment of slaughtered poultry, Academic Periodical of Farm Products Processing, 10, pp. 93-96, (2009); Jing J.Q., Wang L.H., Ye J.P., Wang M., Guo N., Research and application of apparatus for opening the body cavity of poultry, Packaging and Food Machinery, 34, pp. 64-66, (2016); Cornelis, Apparatus for Eviscerating Slaughtered Poultry, (1992); Bendt, Torben, A Method and An Apparatus for Evisceration of Poultry, (2009); Edward J., Device for Eviscerating Slaughtered Poultry, (1991)","Y.

In a traditional poultry house, breeders must usually observe the health of the broilers in person on the basis of their breeding experience at regular times every day. When a breeder finds unhealthy broilers, they are removed manually from the poultry house to prevent viruses from spreading in the poultry house. Therefore, in this study, we designed and constructed a novel small removal system for dead chickens for Taiwanese poultry houses. In the mechanical design, this system mainly contains walking, removal, and storage parts. It comprises robotic arms with a fixed end and sweep-in devices for sweeping dead chickens, a conveyor belt for transporting chickens, a storage cache for storing chickens, and a tracked vehicle. The designed system has dimensions of approximately 1.038 × 0.36 × 0.5 m3, and two dead chickens can be removed in a single operation. The walking speed of the chicken removal system is 3.3 cm/s. In order to enhance the automation and artificial intelligence in the poultry industry, the identification system was used in a novel small removal system. The conditions of the chickens in a poultry house can be monitored remotely by using a camera, and dead chickens can be identified through deep learning based on the YOLO v4 algorithm. The precision of the designed system reached 95.24% in this study, and dead chickens were successfully moved to the storage cache. Finally, the designed system can reduce the contact between humans and poultry to effectively improve the overall biological safety. © 2021 by the authors.

The average white blood count (WBC) is lower in blood samples with citrate and heparin in contrast to EDTA by 30.5% and 24.1%, respectively. The average red blood count (RBC) is lower in tubes with sodium citrate (by 37.9 %) and lithium heparin (by 13.8 %) in contrast to K3-EDTA. When the sodium citrate anticoagulant is used, the blood biochemistry results for all positions of the experiment, excluding calcium, are lower than in heparin, and its closest values are lower than in coagulation activator, excluding trypsin activity. That's why, the most optimal reagents for biochemistry, including for blood enzyme tests, should be considered the tubes with heparin or coagulation activator. © 2021 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","","Agricultural engineering; Agricultural robots; Biochemistry; Coagulation; Ecosystems; Environmental technology; Lithium; Polysaccharides; Reagents; Sodium compounds; All positions; Biochemical indicators; Blood collection; Broiler chickens; Medical science; Morphological indicator; Semi-automatics; Sodium citrate; Blood","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (20-76-10003)","The work was performed based on the grant from the Russian Science Foundation 20-76-10003.","Ponomarev V.A., Pronin V.V., Kletikova L.V., Malovichko L.V., Yakimenko N.N., Clinical and Biochemical Parameters of the Blood of Poultry, (2014); Dolgov V.V., Laboratory Hematology, (2014); Khorovskaya L.A., Kovalevskaya S.N., Vynornova N.B., Kallner A., Transactions of St. Petersburg State I.P.

The robot system was composed of four parts, including a carrying vehicle, spraying unit, environmental sensors and a controller. Two operating modes were supported, fully automatic and remote control. For the low-light and less-irritation conditions in livestock and poultry house, a 'Magnet-RFID' path detection navigation method was proposed to achieve autonomous movement along the livestock and poultry cages. The air-assisted liquid spray nozzle was designed to achieve simultaneous atomization and diffusion of the disinfectant liquid. A fluid dynamics simulation of the air flow field in the nozzle cavity was performed to optimize the structural parameters of its components. The inclination angles of the conical infusion block and the atomization grid were determined to be 75° and 90°, respectively. Finally, the robot's navigation and spraying performance were tested in the livestock and poultry house. The experimental results showed that the robot's vehicle could automatically navigate at the speed of 0.1∼0.5 m/s, and the maximal deviation distance between the actual trajectory and the expected path was 50.8 mm. And the robot can spray liquid disinfectant at a flow rate of 200∼400 mL/min, forming droplets with a diameter (DV.9) of 51.82∼137.23 μm and a deposition density of 116-149 drop per cm2. The research could be a technical support for smart production in the livestock and poultry house.  © 2021 IEEE.","","Agriculture; Air; Atomization; Disinfection; Intelligent robots; Remote control; Spray nozzles; Animal housings; Condition; Environmental sensor; High intensity; Low light; Operating modes; Path detections; Poultry house; Robots system; Spraying robots; Liquids","","","","","Science and Technology General Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission, (KM202112448001); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (20170701605)","*Resrach supported by China National Key Research and Development Plan (20170701605), Science and Technology General Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (KM202112448001).","National Bureau of Statistics of China, China Statistical Yearbook 2020, pp. 350-351, (2020); Zhao Y., Yang L., Zheng S., Xiong B., Advances in the development and applications of intelligent equipment and feeding technology for livestock production, Smart Agriculture, 1, pp. 20-31, (2019); Teng G., Information sensing and environment control of precision facility livestock and poultry farming, Smart Agriculture, 1, pp. 1-12, (2019); Feng Q., Zhang J., Wang X., Status quo of research and application of mechanical disinfection for poultry farming in China, Journal of Domestic Animal Ecology, 40, pp. 82-86, (2019); Zang T., Li B., Zheng W., Influence of droplet size and deposition on slightly acidic electrolyzed water spraying disinfection effect on livestock environment, Transactions of the CSAE, 33, pp. 224-229, (2017); White D., Gurung S., Zhao D., Tabler T., MacDaniel C., Styles D., McKenzie Y., Farnell Y., Foam or spray application of agricultural chemicals to clean and disinfect layer cages, Journal of Applied Poultry Research, 27, pp. 416-423, (2018); Tensa R., Jordan J., Comparison of the application parameters of coccidia vaccines by gel and spray, Poultry Science, 98, pp. 634-641, (2019); Tong H., Zhang J., Hu W., Principles of electric purification epidemic and disease prevention system and its application in chicken coops, Heilongjiang Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, pp. 103-105, (2015); Wu X., Test of livestock and poultry house environment control and epidemic prevention system, Agricultural Engineering, 9, pp. 38-40, (2019); Tang J., Lin B., Wei W., Research on disinfection channel of fully automatic foam vehicle, China Swine Industry, 11, pp. 73-75, (2016); Xing Z., Feng J., Yu Q., Development of hand-held spraying disinfection vehicles for birdhouse, Mechanical Research & Application, 29, pp. 71-72, (2016); Feng Q., Wang X., Design of disinfection robot for livestock breeding, Procedia Computer Science, 1666, pp. 310-314, (2020); Ren G., Lin T., Ying Y., Chowdharye G., Ting K.C., Agricultural robotics research applicable to poultry production: A review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 69, (2020); Xu R., Design and Test of Efficiently Air-Assist Spraying System for Fruits and Vegetables in Greenhouses, (2018); Xu R., Zhang M., Feng Q., Wang X., Zhao C., Design of high-efficiency fruit and vegetables greenhouses air-assisted spraying vehicle, Journal of Agricultural Mechanization Research, 40, pp. 63-69, (2018); Li J., Zhao C., Li S., Droplet deposition characteristics of cfd based orchard air-driven sprayer, Journal of Huazhong Agricultural University, 38, pp. 171-177, (2019); Wu Y., Qian W., Wang D., Study on atomization performance of release agent nozzle based on cfd and orthogonal test, Agricultural Equipment & Vehicle Engineering, 58, pp. 104-107, (2020); Gu W., Research on Flow Characteristic and Deposition Performance Based on Contacted Charge, (2016); Chen J., Optimization of Electrostatic Spray Parameter for Flat Fan Nozzle and Experimental Study on Electrostatic Spraying in Poultry House, (2019); Yuan H., Wang G., Effects of droplet size and deposition density on field efficacy of pesticides, Plant Protection, pp. 9-16, (2015)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd WRC Symposium on Advanced Robotics and Automation, WRC SARA 2021","11 September 2021 through 11 September 2021","Beijing","174513","","978-166541823-2","","","English","WRC Symp.

At the same time, there is a gradual process of increasing the load on the system over time which leads to an increase in power loss in power transmission lines and the appearance of additional energy sources within the existing network. The chapter analyzes the effect of integration of distributed production on power losses in power supply lines with the distributed load. The power supply systems of poultry farms were analyzed as the objects of the research. The peculiarity of the present scheme of connection of additional power sources based on photovoltaic systems is that there are several additional power sources connected to the optimal places of joining loads for reducing losses in the supply line. The changes in the value of loss reduction in comparison with the initial line with the optimal combination of power and places of connection of additional sources are analyzed. There was found the maximum level of loss reduction for any given number of additional power supplies. The proposed method of calculation of the connection of power sources on the basis of photovoltaic systems allows to determine the different combinations of optimal power and connection points by the obtained analytical expressions. To reduce the calculations, there was presented the nomogram for determining various combinations of distances to the connection point and capacities of photovoltaic systems with minimal losses in the power supply line. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.","Active power; Additional source; Distributed load; Optimal connection point; Photovoltaic system; Power loss","Distributed computer systems; Photovoltaic cells; Robotics; Active power; Additional source; Connection points; Distributed loads; Photovoltaic systems; Power-losses; Electric load loss","","","","","","","Junxia M., Binqing G., Fuchao L., Peidong D., Study on power loss of distribution network with distributed generation and its reactive power optimization problem, International Conference on Power System Technology, pp. 1213-1216, (2014); Atwa Y.M., El-Saadany E.F., Reliability evaluation for distribution system with renewable distributed generation during islanded mode of operation, IEEE Trans.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the operation of robots in a poultry grow-out house environment is feasible from an animal behavior perspective. To determine this, an experiment was conducted operating both an aerial and a ground robot in a small-scale grow-out house housing broiler chickens for a typical growth cycle (6 weeks). Humans also interacted with the flock daily. The environment and robots were equipped with cameras and other sensors to record data for the entire duration of the experiment. The research team established a set of measurable metrics with which to quantitatively assess the impact of operating the robots. These metrics included average avoidance distance, average speed when avoiding, and average recovery time. A software program was developed to assist in the analysis of these metrics. Analysis shows that there are statistical differences in the average avoidance distance metric but there is no significant difference between the average speeds, or with the recovery time metric, indicating that operating robots in the environment is no more stressful to the chicken than the presence of a human. © 2014 IEEE.","","Animals; Information science; Robotics; Robots; Animal reactions; Average recovery; Broiler chickens; Distance metrics; Research institutes; Software program; Statistical differences; University of Georgia; Signal processing","","","","","","","Hemsworth P.H., Coleman G.J., Barnett J.L., Jones R.B., Behavioural responses to humans and the productivity of commercial broiler chickens, Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 41, 1-2, pp. 101-114, (1994); Schultz M.A., Human-robot interaction: A survey, Trends Hum.-Comput.

On the basis of researches of infrared heating systems in poultry house an engineering technique for calculating the temperature regime in module for growing poultry has been developed. The module was equipped with an infrared heater and an exhaust outlet and allows designing efficient infrared heating systems in agricultural premises to ensure standard temperature regime. In this case, the technique is only resolved when the conditions for providing the required temperature and air speed parameters are met. If the temperature of the module tin changes from 16 °C to 35 °C, and inflow air speed varies from 0.2 m/s to 0.3 m/s, the infrared heating system and the ventilation system completely provide the normalized air temperature in the irradiation area. Based on an algorithm using a developed technique a computer program was developed. This program allows, through the use of a simple method of substituting input factors, to determine the parameters of the temperature regime of the module for poultry breeding. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Engineering calculation; Exhaust outlet; Infrared heater; Module four poultry breeding; Thermal power","Agricultural robots; Heating equipment; Ventilation; Air temperature; Engineering techniques; Infrared heaters; Input factors; Poultry house; Temperature parameters; Temperature regimes; Ventilation systems; Infrared heating","","","","","","","Ukraine’s energy strategy for the period up to 2030; Kocaman B., Esenbuga N., Yildiz A., Lacin E., Macit M., Effect of environmental conditions in poultry houses on the performance of laying hens, Int.

Despite the scientific and technological advances implemented, the sector still has a generally low level of technological maturity compared with other sectors. Industry 4.0 strongly focuses on smart manufacturing, including specific principles and technologies. This study aimed to identify Industry 4.0 approaches (technologies, projected benefits and barriers to Industry 4.0) and main applicabilities in the broiler meat production chain in the poultry sector. A systematic review of literature was conducted in three databases, using formal protocols for ordering and selecting bibliographic materials. Two topics were included: general implementations in Industry 4.0 and Industry 4.0 in the poultry sector (broiler production chain). Overall, the benefits of Industry 4.0 are inherent to the economic dimension, with a certain predisposition to integrated dimensions (economic and environmental). The main barriers to Industry 4.0, also known as inhibiting factors, are high investments, the lack of knowledge (generally or through methods or technical procedures), uncertainties in results, and challenges in qualifying human capital. Regarding Industry 4.0 technologies, the most employed in the broiler production chain (aviaries and slaughterhouses, mainly) are artificial intelligence (robots and/or software), Big Data Analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). © 2023 World’s Poultry Science Association.","Industry 4.0;

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in single-object detection, addressing the complexity of multi-object detection, requires advanced approaches. To overcome this challenge, we implement advanced algorithms like YOLOv8, SSD, and Faster RCNN. The primary goal is to analyze their performance, focusing on accuracy, speed, and adaptability. We aim to balance computational efficiency with optimal resource utilization, considering hardware constraints. Integrating these models into precision farming systems and adapting to environmental variations are key challenges. This project specifically aims to validate YOLOv8's effectiveness, and yields an accuracy around 98% in poultry farming scenarios.

Both the number of poultry raised and the output of products have increased significantly compared to before. China's animal husbandry is gradually moving towards regionalization, industrialization, and scale. This requires the state's support for animal husbandry in terms of policy, financial guarantee, and personnel training. At present, China's livestock industry accounts for about 30% of the primary industry, and it has become an important pillar of the primary industry.

As a matter of fact, health behavior such as dead or sick can lead to higher infectious rate and poor health of people, hence, it has a main impact on the whole livestock health system. In order to achieve the automatic monitoring of dead or sick poultry, a method of health behavior recognition based on computer vision technology is proposed in this study. The computer vision technology is based on the class libraries MFC and the computer vision libraries OpenCV, and it can provide a effective algorithm to identify the health behavior. This algorithm is based on yellow feature extraction and ""AND"" operation. To identify the yellow feature, b∗ of the L∗a∗b∗ color space is taken as characteristic quantity, the histogram equalization method is adopted to improve image quality. OTSU method is used as the segmentation criterion, the noise is removed effectively based on morphological operation, and this algorithm is proposed according to the judgment standard that whether the numbers of layers' leg feature in the process of image-processing are consistent with actual situation. The experimental samples were 100 groups layers that were 50 weeks old, three or four layers were placed in the cage, and the layer's feature was collected by vision system that consisted of a CMOS camera, a mobile vehicle, computer and controller. The field of each picture taken by camera should be consistent with the width of one whole cage. The total success rate of recognizable layers' health behaviour is 86%, which demonstrates this algorithm is feasible. This study can be used to guide the design of automatic biology monitoring robot.

Due to the high consumption and rising energy prices in this industry, it is necessary to replace the current fuel sources with renewable sources such as solar energy to reduce production costs. Therefore, “considering the effective factors on the feasibility of utilizing solar energy in the poultry industry” is the main goal of this qualitative research. This research is an applied type of research, and (systematic) grounded theory is used. The data were collected by performing in-depth semi-structured interviews with the 13 agricultural experts in this field. Data analysis was done by using MAX qualitative data analysis version 12.3 software (maxqdav12.3) in three steps: open coding, axial coding, and selective coding to identify dimensions, main categories, subcategories, and concepts related to codes. The results of this study identified 32 initial codes and six main following factors were categorized: causal conditions, pivotal phenomenon, interventionist factors, contextual factors, strategies, consequences, and the relationship between them was analyzed.

Concerning this issue, this paper proposed a framework which will monitor the field. That is by identifying the intruder around the field by utilizing sensor, at that point camera will bind the picture of the intruder and classifies the image by using the image processing and machine-learning tool and afterward the appropriate activity will be upheld by the raspberry-pi dependent on the kind of the intruder. At last, the notification is notified to the farm owner. © 2021 IEEE.","Buzzer; IOT; LED; PIR sensor; Raspberry-pi","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Animals; Automation; Cellular radio systems; Image processing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Water management; Wireless networks; Human lives; Internet of Things (IOT); Physical objects; Smart agricultures; Smart homes; Internet of things","","","","","","","Krishna Jha R., Kumar S., Joshi K., Pandey R., Field monitoring using IoT in agriculture, International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Instrumentation and Control Technologies, (2017); Pallavi S., Mallapur J.D., Bendigeri K.Y., Remote sensing and controlling of greenhouse agriculture parameters based on IoT, International Conference on Big Data, IoT and Data Science (BID), (2017); Prathibha S.R., Hongal A., Jyothi M.P., IoT based monitoring system in smart agriculture, International Conference on Recent Advances in Electronics and Communication Technology, (2017); Ammad Uddin M., Mansour A., Le Jeune D., Hadi A.M., Agriculture internet of things: Ag-iot, 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference, (2017); Shareef Mekala M., Viswanathan D.P., A survey: Smart agriculture IoT with cloud computing, IEEE, (2017); Sarkar P.J., Chanagala S., A survey on IoT based digital agriculture monitoring system and their impact on optimal utilization of resources, IOSR Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering (IOSR-JECE) 11, 1, (2016); Shanmugasundaram R., Pavithra S., Sangeetha V., Tamilselvan S., Thanveer Ahmed A.H., IoT based animal tracking and monitoring system in zoo, South Asian Journal of Engineering and Technology, 3, 2, pp. 162-168, (2017); Uma Maheswari P., Rose Rajan A., Animal intrusion detection system using wireless sensor networks, International Journal of Advanced Research in Biology Engineering Science and Technology (IJARBEST), 2, 10, (2016); Pampapathi B.S., Manjunath P.C., Intrusion detection using passive infrared sensor (pir), Asian Journal of Engineering and Technology Innovation, 4; Akyildiz I.F., Su W., Sankarasubramaniam Y., Cayirci E., A survey on sensor networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 40, 8, pp. 104-112, (2002); Atzori L., Iera A., Morabito G., The internet of things: A survey, Computer Networks, 54, pp. 2787-2805, (2010); Chang H., Zhou N., Zhao X., Cao Q., Tan M., Zhang Y., A new agriculture monitoring system based on wsns, 2014 12th International Conference on Signal Processing (ICSP), (2014); Na A., Isaac W., Varshney S., Khan E., An IoT based system for remote monitoring of soil characteristics, International Conference on Information Technology (InCITe)-The Next Generation IT Submit, (2016); Chavan C.H., Karande P.V., Wireless monitoring of soil moisture temperature & humidity using zigbee in agriculture, International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology (IJETT), 11, (2014); Ammad-Uddin M., Sharif Z., Et al., Internetof-things (IoT)-based smart agriculture: Toward making the fields talk, ICCUBEA, (2017); Muhammad Z., Md Azri Asyraf Hafez M., Adni M.L.N., Et al., Smart agriculture using IoT with raspberry pi, ICCSCE, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Intelligent Communication Technologies and Virtual Mobile Networks, ICICV 2021","4 February 2021 through 6 February 2021","Tirunelveli","168213","","978-073811183-4","","","English","Proc.

Intelligent information perception ideas for different application scenarios are stimulated with the rapid development of sensors, information communication and robotics technologies and artificial intelligence-based information processing technologies worldwide. Intelligent perception of information in the poultry farming process is important for the liberation of labor, safeguarding animal welfare, and improving the automation and efficiency of poultry farming. In this review, the information perception framework in modern poultry farming has been analyzed to fully illustrate the important role of information perception in modern poultry farming. In addition, we have reviewed the research of information perception technology in poultry farming in 26 countries around the world. According to the different research goals, it is mainly divided into five aspects: individual poultry target perception, behavior recognition, health and environmental monitoring, and breeding-related robots. Some tables are provided to summarize and review research information on different topics. We found that for the information perception in poultry breeding, many challenges still need to be solved, such as the accurate perception of poultry individual information in complex environment, multi-scale monitoring of poultry house environment, intelligent disease diagnosis and exception handling, robot function expansion and multi-robot coordination. To achieve the goal of accurate, efficient, and intelligent perception of information in the unmanned poultry farming system, we have also pointed out the future research focus and development trends respectively by combining the characteristics of different problems. © 2022","Intelligent information perception; Poultry; Precision poultry farming; Unmanned poultry farming system","Animals; Behavioral research; Coordination reactions; Intelligent robots; Animal husbandry; Application scenario; Farming system; Information perception; Intelligent information; Intelligent information perception; Intelligent perception; Precision poultry farming; Sensor informations; Unmanned poultry farming system; automation; communication; disease; information processing; livestock farming; perception; poultry; robotics; Diagnosis","","","","","Key R&D Program of Zhejiang Province, (2021C02026)","This work was supported by the Key R&D Program of Zhejiang Province (No. 2021C02026).

In contrast, cages have been banned and are being phased out in Europe. In particular, broilers are and have been kept in large flocks on a littered floor. Both systems however, do have issues related to indoor environment, health and welfare. Various precision livestock farming (PLF) inspired systems have been developed to better monitor and thus improve the climatic conditions for floor based poultry systems (RoboChick, Octopus, ChickenBoy) For the caged housing system, a large consortium of Chinese and UK industry and academia developed a dedicated autonomous data collection platform. The data platform combines robot technology with advanced sensors and indoor environmental management using real-time monitoring to maintain the best environmental and animal welfare conditions, improving production yield, and providing early detection of poultry disease and minimal anti-biotics use. The prototype autonomous navigating robot was developed in the UK and fitted with the sensors and datalogging systems. A bespoke user interface was developed to map the environment the robot would be operating in and allow assignment of monitoring positions. The navigation systems were tested in a caged poultry facility in the UK and proven to be highly accurate and reliable in positioning the robot and avoiding obstacles essential for autonomous operation. The jointly developed monitoring systems were integrated with the platforms software and bespoke cloud based databases. © ECPLF 2022.

Taking into account this fact, a scientific study of the indicated problem was carried out regarding one of the dynamically developing subsectors of animal husbandry, namely poultry farming. An assessment of the prospects for the functioning of the industry is given and the fact of an increase in the number of unprofitable enterprises is established. In this regard, the adaptation of a progressive model of financial forecasting with a compensating variable based on the data of a poultry enterprise was carried out. Various modifications of the proposed model have been used, with a step-by-step approach to preliminary, intermediate and forecast balances. The final results of the work carried out made it possible to develop various strategies for the behavior of the managers of the poultry enterprise in the formation of the value of its own funds, as well as navigate the volumes of possible borrowed sources of the financed property. Demonstrated the variability of changes in balance sheet items at different percentages of growth in sales. The integration of the results obtained indicates the effectiveness and progressiveness of the financial forecasting model using the compensating variable in relation to the poultry industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular system; Finance; Agricultural sector; Circulatory systems; Effective Functioning; Financial forecasting; Poultry industry; Progressive models; Scientific studies; Step-by-step approach; Forecasting","","","","","","","Reuter L M, Zazykina L A, Vedenkina I V, Valdohina S I, Akopyan A G, Methodology for assessing the economic viability of poultry enterprises, Poultry and poultry products, 2, pp. 67-70, (2020); Fisinin V I, World and Russian poultry farming: realities and challenges of the future monograph, (2020); Vedenkina I V, Strategic planning as a vector of the poultry industry development IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, (2019); Bocharov V V, Comprehensive financial analysis, (2016); Novikov A I, Financial market models and forecasting in the financial sector Textbook, (2015); Rogova E M, Tkachenko E A, Fundamentals of Financial Management and Financial Planning, (2014); Sergeev I V, Shipitsyn I V, Operational financial planning at the enterprise, (2016); Ayres R, Scientific and technical forecasting and long-term planning, (2013)","I.V.

Bulk commodities destined for restaurants needed to be repackaged as restaurants were closed due to the pandemic. Meat processing plants had to reduce production rates as COVID-19 outbreaks among their employees slowed production lines and increased the required time for sanitation of facilities to take place. These processing reductions led to commodity stockpiles in excess of what could be processed before spoilage. Milk needed to be land spread as a waste product, swine and poultry needed to be depopulated and disposed of since continued feeding was not feasible, and other specialty crops needed to be disposed of when storage capacity limits were reached. NRCS took steps to provide producers with technical and financial help to address the proper disposal of depopulated animals. This paper will detail the steps taken by NRCS to address this issue to protect natural resources on the farm and the environment. © ASABE 2021 Annual International Meeting","Animal mortality; COVID; Production","Agricultural robots; Dairies; Agricultural commodities; Agricultural productions; Meat processing plants; Processing rates; Production line; Production rates; Storage capacity; Virtual learning; Agriculture","","","","","South Dakota","The pandemic began to impact producers in April 2020 which is over halfway into the fiscal year. To address the emergency animal mortality brought about by the pandemic, NRCS made incentive payments available to eligible producers through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). EQIP provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers to address natural resource concerns and deliver environmental benefits. Through this program, farmers and ranchers were able to apply for financial assistance related to emergency animal mortality management practices resulting from the animal processing plant closures in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and South Dakota. NRCS provided $12,500,000 of additional funds from a national reserved funding pool to the eight states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and South Dakota) in response to COVID-19. This was in addition to the $12,500,000 of funds the states reallocated from their own previously allotted state EQIP funds. Financial assistance was primarily targeted at livestock operations that would need emergency animal mortality assistance due to the pandemic.","Owens W.E., Final Report September 2019: NRCS Contribution Agreement for Demonstration and Education Efforts Regarding Catastrophic Losses in Poultry, (2019); Swine Veterinarian Shares Lessons Learned from COVID-19 Disruptions, (2020); National Handbook of Conservation Practices, (2020); Yaffe-Bellany C.M.D., Dumped milk, smashed eggs, plowed vegetables: Food waste of the pandemic, The New York Times, (2020)","","","American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers","","2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual International Meeting, ASABE 2021","12 July 2021 through 16 July 2021","Virtual, Online","171397","","978-171383353-6","","","English","Am.

The robot system is composed of four components, namely the automatic bearing vehicle, the disinfection spraying unit, the environmental monitoring sensors, and the controller. The robot supports two working modes: fully automatic mode and remote control mode. Aiming at the low-light and low-stress condition in the livestock and poultry houses, the method for detecting navigation path based on ""Magnet-RFID"" marks in the ground was proposed to realize the robot's automatic moving between the cages. In view of the large-flow and long-range requirements of the disinfectant's spraying, the air-assisted nozzle was designed, which could atomize and disperse the liquid independently. Based on the CFD simulation of airflow in the nozzle, the nozzle's parts structural parameters were optimized, as the angle of the cone-shaped guide pad and the inclination angle of the grid respectively determined as 75°and 90°. Finally, the robot's performance was tested in a poultry house in Beijing. The results showed that, the robot's mobile platform could automatically navigate at the speed of 0.1－0.5 m/s, and the maximal deviation distance between the actual trajectory and the expected path was 50.8 mm. The air-assisted nozzle could realize the atomization and diffusion of the liquid medicine at the same time, and was suitable for spraying the liquid medicine with a flow rate of 200－400 mL/min. The diameter (DV.9) of the liquid droplets formed was 51.82－137.23 μL, and became larger as the flow rate of the liquid medicine increased. The deposition density of spray droplets formed by the nozzle was 116－149/cm2, and decreased as the spray distance increased. The size and density of the liquid droplets of the spray nozzle in different areas of the cage all met the index requirements for effectively killing adherent pathogenic microorganisms. The robot could be applied as an automatic sprayer for disinfectant and immune reagent in the livestock and poultry house. © 2021.

To provide the population with meat, milk, and wool, the volume of livestock products is increasing, which entails the development of forage production. The development of feed production is possible by improving the quality of products and reducing the cost of feed production. The quality can be improved by using the extrusion method, which increases the digestibility and nutritional value of feed. The addition of sapropel provides animals with vitamins and minerals. As a result of the scientific and economic experiments conducted on broiler chickens, it was found that birds that were fed with extruded sapropele grain had a greater weight gain. For the production of extruded sapropelic feed, an extruder with a double-entry screw and conical compression rings can be used. It can reduce extrusion losses and the screw length. To determine the design parameters, it is necessary to develop a mathematical model of the pressure change in the extruder along the screw length. Having analyzed the mixture movement through the annular conical channel of the die and built an equilibrium equation for the elementary section, we have a mathematical model for determining the pressure in front of the forming head. In a similar way, a mathematical model was built to determine the pressing pressure in front of the compression seal. The paper describes mathematical relationships for determining the pressure at any point in the extruder. Using the mathematical relationships, design parameters that affect the pressure in the extruder have been determined. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Animals; Extrusion; Screws; Compression rings; Compression seals; Design parameters; Economic experiments; Equilibrium equation; Mathematical relationship; Nutritional value; Quality of product; Extruders","","","","","","","Babayan I V, Vasileva O A, Voloshuk L A, Features of development of agriculture, Bulletin of the Altai Academy of Economics and Law, 5, pp. 19-23, (2019); Priporov I E, Bachu T N, Trends of the protein feeds production technology improvement, Bulletin of Orenburg State Agrarian University, 2, pp. 104-106, (2019); Otarov A I, The influence of heat treatment of grain of various forage crops on the growth and development of fattening gobies of kalmyk breed Veterinary Medicine, Animal Science and Biotechnology, 9, pp. 74-80, (2019); Fattakhova Z F, Shakirov S K, Krupin E O, Bikchantaev I T, Shayakhmetova L N, Askarova A A, The chemical composition, nutrition and fractional composition of winter rye grain proteins after various methods of exposure, Carpathian journal of food science and technology, 1, pp. 71-79, (2020); Pietsch V L, Werner R, Karbstein H P, Emin M A, High moisture extrusion of wheat gluten: relationship between process parameters, protein polymerization, and final product characteristics, Journal of food engineering, 259, pp. 3-11, (2019); Tangjaidee P, Xiang J, Yin H, Wen X, Quek S Y, Selenium, fibre, and protein enrichment of rice product: extrusion variables and product properties, Food quality and safety, 1, pp. 40-51, (2019); Ignatenkov V G, Bogdanov K A, Ivanov E A, Ivanov A I, Aleksandrov D A, Research of the drum cellular percentage feeder working of a vitamin-fodder additive of multi-purpose grinding and mixing machine based on a sapropel, Bulletin of Kurgan State Agricultural Academy, 2, pp. 62-65, (2020); Vasileva M I, Bychkova K V, Arzhankova Yu V, Ignatenkov V G, Live weight of broiler chickens when added to the diet of extruded wheat separately and mixed with sapropel, Izvestia of Velikie Luki State Agricultural Academy, 1, pp. 2-8, (2020); Priporov I E, Shepelev A B, Yagyaev E R, Improvement of extruders for preparing protein feed from sunflower seeds, Bulletin of Orenburg State Agrarian University, 2, pp. 145-148, (2020); Pakhomov V I, Braginets S V, Bakhchevnikov O N, Alferov A S, Rudoy D V, Extrusion technologies of feed and food including biomass of insects (review), Agricultural Science of the Euro-North-East, 3, pp. 233-244, (2020); Pakhomov V I, Braginets S V, Bakhchevnikov O N, Alferov A S, Rukhlyada A I, Babajanyan A S, The results of experimental studies of extrusion of feed containing wheat grain and black soldier fly larvae biomass, Agricultural Science of the Euro-North-East, 1, pp. 28-42, (2020); Fominykh A V, Mikhailyuk E N, Fomina S V, Kovshova N A, Calculation method of pneumatic extruded soybean handling installation, Bulletin of Kurgan State Agricultural Academy, 2, pp. 78-80, (2019); Fominykh A V, Ovchinnikov D N, Fomina S V, Production line of full-fat extruded soya with recovery of the heat energy, Bulletin of Kurgan State Agricultural Academy, 3, pp. 83-85, (2014); Shishkin V V, Mikhalyev V V, Usanov V S, Feed additive produced by extrusion of the mineral-enriched soybeans: optimization of homogeneity in mixing components, Far Eastern Agrarian Bulletin, 3, pp. 199-205, (2017); Gorb S S, Technological process of extrusion and analysis of modern designs for press extruders preparing concentrated forage in animal husbandry, Scientific life, 2, pp. 98-103, (2019)","","","IOP Publishing Ltd","","2020 International Conference on Engineering Studies and Cooperation in Global Agricultural Production, ESCGAP 2020","27 August 2020 through 28 August 2020","Zernograd, Rostov Region","167255","17551307","","","","English","IOP Conf.

The energy consumption of the feeding robot is one of the important elements of concern in the process of path planning. In this study, the shortest path does not mean that the feeding robot consumes the least energy, because the total mass of the feeding robot keeps changing during the feeding process. It is necessary to find the most suitable path so that the feeding robot consumes the lowest amount of energy during the feeding process. A branch and bound algorithm to calculate the minimum energy consumption travel path for small-scale buckets lacking feed is proposed. The lower bound of the branch and bound on the energy consumption is obtained by the approach of preferred selection of the set of shortest edges combined with the sequence inequality, and the upper bound could be obtained based on Christofides’s Heuristic algorithm. A double-crossover operator genetic algorithm based on an upper bound on energy consumption for large-scale buckets lacking feed is proposed, and different crossover operations are performed according to the relationship between the fitness value and the upper bound of energy consumption in order to find a better path. The experiment results show that the approach proposed in this study is efficient; for small-scale buckets lacking feed, a branch and bound algorithm could calculate the minimum energy consumption path of 17 points in 300 s, and for large-scale buckets lacking feed, a double-crossover operator genetic algorithm based on an upper bound on energy consumption could calculate the minimum energy consumption travel path within 30 points in 60 s.

These involve raising farm animals in densely populated environment, commonly termed as a factory livestock farming. Such an operation is actually aimed at yielding a very large scale of farm animal products by means of intensification in animal rearing systems. This is becoming a global trend in practicing farm animal productions nowadays. The transformation of livestock production from a family small scale animal husbandry to a large scale of corporate business has been mainly driven by three major interrelated factors, these are i) a prediction on a rapid world's human population growth, ii) demographic factors, particularly age structure and urbanization, and iii) socio-economic status improvement. The total world's population has been estimated to reach 9.1 billion in 2050, where 70 percent of rural inhabitants are going to shift mostly living in urban areas and with their better incomes than previously earned and are also predicted to increase by 2 percent annually. Indications in changing urban lifestyle has then been shown affecting on shifted food consumption patterns more to semi-processed and/or pre-prepared-ready to eat foods of which their main component deriving from livestock product origin. As the trend has been commonly shown in many urban areas, where their working hours are becoming longer than there used to be. In an actual fact, that has been happening for the last two decades, particularly in regions used to be identified as developing countries, such as in Southeast Asia, Sub Saharan Africa, West Asia and North Africa. Consequently, an increase rate in meat consumption has been estimated at over 4 percent per annum. Moreover, that change has become a sequential driving factor for the rapid growth in the meat production sector. As higher consumer preference in chicken meat than that in other types, global broiler production is holding supremacy over the other meat complex. A special highlight on Brunei Darussalam poultry industry development will also be addressed here, particularly to focusing on an industry dynamic based on data posted in country's agricultural statistics for the year of 2013 [1]. At that time when the country was reported to fulfil its self-sufficiency in chicken meat with a consumption per capita per year reached 58.5 kg. The figure was accounted as being the second highest chicken meat consumption per capita per year in the world after Hong Kong. In line with the global trend in livestock production, continuous growing demands for the products had also led to intensification in livestock farming in the Southeast Asia region. As far as the factory livestock farming as has gone more common operations up to now, and yet there might have been more and more questionable arguments over negative impacts arising, particularly in regards to animal welfare, human health and environmental degradations will be seemingly left hard to answer as most vast scientific empirical assessments required, nonetheless the matter may only open for discussions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agricultural robots; Animals; Developing countries; Economics; Food supply; Meats; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Broiler productions; Consumer preferences; Demographic factors; Empirical assessment; Human population growth; Livestock production; Sequential driving; Socio-economic status; Agriculture","","","","","","","Darussalam Department Of Agriculture B., Agrifood, Agriculture and Agrifood Statistcs in Brief for the Year of 2013, (2013); The World Bank Annual Report 2008 Year in Review, Open Knowl.

These challenges are further exacerbated by a rapidly growing demand for food production, labor shortages, and a global pandemic. The process of segmenting a chicken to individual, retail pieces is quite involved, and a key step in this pipeline is placing a processed chicken onto shackles. Traditionally, this is performed by humans; however, the lack of a steady labor supply threatens the throughput of this processing step. In order to ensure food security, current agricultural practices will have no choice but to adopt new technologies and methods, and one such technology is robotics. In this paper, we present an automated system that performs chicken shackling. The system consists of a Universal Robots' UR5 manipulator, an Intel Realsense 435d RGB-D camera, and several software components. The camera can perceive a whole, defeathered chicken product in a random initial pose and accurately estimates the position and orientation of the hock. The UR5 manipulator then autonomously grabs this joint with a custom end effector and places it onto a shackle. This technology furthers the automation of the food industry and pushes the application of robotics in a semi-structured and difficult environment. © ASABE 2021 Annual International Meeting","Automation; Deep learning; Machine vision; Poultry; Rehang; Robotics","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Animals; Cameras; Computer vision; Employment; Food supply; Industrial manipulators; Industrial robots; Manufacture; Meats; Robotics; Agricultural practices; Automated systems; Food industries; Labor shortages; Position and orientations; Processing steps; Semi-structured; Software component; Manipulators","","","","","","","Coleman D., Sucan I., Chitta S., Correll N., Reducing the Barrier to Entry of Complex Robotic Software: A Moveit!

The current system often identifies infections too late, resulting in mass culling of flocks. The proposed solution is to use disease control through vaccination as an alternate approach. The proof of concept for this paper was implemented using the Raspberry Pi 4 along with Arduino UNOs, which was adapted to better suit the needs of the paper. The system was able to collect data from sensors measuring variables such as Ammonia, Carbon Dioxide, temperature, and humidity. The wellbeing of the chicken can be monitored through the environmental variables being sensed. Based on studies, deviations in these variables from the baseline can indicate the presence of disease. Some systems also listen to sounds to understand if illnesses are prevalent. The data will be passed through a series of conditions to determine the probability of infection within the farm. Experimental analyses through simulations were conducted with the mobile robot connected with sensors. Based on the significant deviation of sensor outputs from the benchmark values, the presence of disease in the livestock was detected in the early stages. © 2023 IEEE.","Arduino UNO; Early Disease Detection; Poultry; Raspberry Pi 4; Robotics","Agriculture; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Disease control; Security systems; Alternate approaches; Arduino UNO; Current system; Early disease detection; Poultry farms; Proof of concept; Raspberry pi 4; Smart surveillance systems; Surveillance systems; Wellbeing; Robotics","","","","","","","U.AE Food Security Ed: Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority, (2023); Food and Agriculture Organization of the; Butcher G.D., Mather F.B., Jacob J.P., Common Poultry Diseases, (2019); Firman J.D., Prevention of Poultry Disease, (1996); Fabian E.E., Detecting Ammonia in Poultry Housing Using Inexpensive Instruments, Ed: PennState Extension, (2019); Reece F.N., Lott B.D., Effect of Carbon Dioxide on Broiler Chicken Performance, Ed, (1980); Astill J., Dara R.A., Frazer E.D.G., Sharif S., Detecting and Predicting Emerging Disease in Poultry with the Implementation of New Technologies and Big Data: A Focus on Avian Influenza Virus, Review, 2018, (2018); Pokphand Group C., Using Robots at Pinggu Layer Chicken Farming Project, Ed, (2017); Ioannou C.C., Swarm intelligence in fish? the difficulty in demonstrating distributed and self-organised collective intelligence in (some) animal groups, Behavioural Processes, 141, pp. 141-151, (2017)","K.J.

To provide a quality livestock production, i.e. poultry, the optimum environment must be maintained. Chicken poultry farm is one of the important sectors for food supply. An active monitoring system that maintains the optimum environmental conditions, such as level of ammonia, carbon dioxide, humidity, and temperature, can be developed using internet of things (IoT) for precision agriculture. In this paper, a smart chicken poultry farm using real-time operating system (RTOS) on Arduino will be developed. The level of ammonia and carbon dioxide will be sensed using various sensors and exhaust DC fans will be used to regulate to the optimum level. Furthermore, the humidity and temperature will be measured as well and will be controlled by a DC fan and heat lamp. Experimental results showed that RTOS on Arduino performs better compared to the non-RTOS on Arduino. This is due to the task priority could be assigned in RTOS, in which higher priority task could be completed first. © 2019 IEEE.","Arduino; IoT; precision agriculture; RTOS; smart farm","Agricultural robots; Ammonia; Animals; Carbon dioxide; Computer operating systems; Food supply; Humidity control; Internet of things; Active monitoring; Agriculture sectors; Ammonia and carbon dioxide; Environmental conditions; Humidity and temperatures; Internet of Things (IOT); Livestock production; Real time operating system; Agriculture","","","","","","","Alam M.M., Siwar C., Murad M.W., Toriman M., Impacts of climate change on agriculture and food security issues in malaysia: An empirical study on farm level assessment, World Applied Sciences Journal, 14, pp. 431-442, (2017); Habib F.Q., Abu Dardak R., Zakaria S., Consumers' preference andconsumption towards fast food: Evidences from malaysia, Business &management Quaterly Review, 2, pp. 14-27, (2011); Laying down minimum rules for the protection ofchickens kept for meat production, Official Journal of the EuropeanUnion, 182, pp. 19-28, (2007); Mansor H., Azlin A.N., Gunawan T.S., Kamal M.M., Hashim A.Z., Development of smart chicken poultry farm, IndonesianJournal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 10, pp. 498-505, (2018); Jindarat S., Wuttidittachotti P., Smart farm monitoring usingraspberry pi and arduino, 2015 International Conference OnComputer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT, pp. 284-288, (2015); Mahale R.B., Sonavane S., Smart poultry farm monitoring usingiot and wireless sensor networks, International Journal of AdvancedResearch in Computer Science, 7, (2016); Corkery G., Ward S., Kenny C., Hemmingway P., Incorporatingsmart sensing technologies into the poultry industry, Journal of world'Spoultry Research, 3, pp. 106-128, (2013); Halachmi I., Guarino M., Precision livestock farming: A 'peranimal'approach using advanced monitoring technologies, Animal, 10, pp. 1482-1483, (2016); Belleza R.R., De Freitas E.P., Performance study of real-timeoperating systems for internet of things devices, IET Software, 12, pp. 176-182, (2018); Taivalsaari A., Mikkonen T., A taxonomy of iot client architectures, IEEE Software, 35, pp. 83-88, (2018); Siewert S., Pratt J., Real-Time Embedded Components and Systems with Linux and RTOS, (2015); Back M., Freertos: A Practical Approach with Arduino, (2018); Gunawan T.S., Yaldi I.R.H., Kartiwi M., Mansor H., Performanceevaluation of smart home system using internet of things, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 8, (2018); Chou T., Precision-Principles Practices and Solutions for the Internet OfThings, (2017); Gunawan T.S., Anuar M.H., Kartiwi M., Janin Z., Design of powerfactor meter using internet of things for power factor improvement, remote monitoring and data logging, Indonesian Journal of ElectricalEngineering and Computer Science, 17, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society Malaysia Chapter","6th IEEE International Conference on Smart Instrumentation, Measurement and Application, ICSIMA 2019","27 August 2019 through 29 August 2019","Kuala Lumpur","159025","","978-172813952-4","","","English","IEEE Int.

Modern broiler production in large sheds holding upwards of 50 000 birds uses indoor climate control based on a handful of fixed-location sensors, often well above the bird-occupied zone. Significant deviations from optimal climate conditions for the birds are common, but installing a higher-density grid of fixed sensors is not cost effective. A robotic platform, moving through the flock of birds and collecting detailed spacial information on a wide range of climate parameters at bird level, enables accurate decisions to be made to optimise the climate in large sheds being made in real time. 2. A preliminary study investigated the feasibility of running a mobile robotic platform among a flock of broiler chickens for an entire 6-week cycle. Bird behaviour in response to the robot was studied. 3. In total, 1597 Ross 308 broiler chicks were housed in a room that was set up to replicate a commercial environment. The robot was driven along a fixed route three times a day (Monday–Friday) for the whole cycle under manual control. Behaviour was studied using camera footage. 4. The birds showed very little ‘startled’ behaviour in response to the robot and were quick to fill the area behind the robot as it moved past. Activity levels increased during robot runs but to a lesser extent than during walk-through by a human stockman. The challenges of operating the robot changed as the birds grew, with many individuals coming into physical contact with the front of the robot later in the cycle. Despite this, very few birds refused to move out of the way completely, and mortality and production parameters remained acceptable throughout. 5. This study has shown that running a mobile robot among a flock of broiler chickens is possible between 3 and 37 d in a cycle and causes limited disruption to bird behaviour. Future work needs to repeat this trial on multiple flocks to see whether running a mobile robot among the broilers can be achieved in a commercial setting, with limited disruption to bird behaviour. © 2020 British Poultry Science Ltd.","activity; Behaviour; broilers; FCR; mortality; robot","Animals; Chickens; Robotics; animal; chicken; robotics","","","","","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC, (BB/R021589/1); Innovate UK, (132864)","This work was supported by Innovate UK (reference: 132864) and BBSRC (grant: BB/R021589/1).

The current domestic research focuses on theoretical analysis and does not focus on a specific city. Aiming at the changes in agricultural product prices in Chengdu, this article first proposes hypotheses in terms of income effect, price expectation effect and cost effect, and then selects the prices of agricultural products around the Spring Festival in 2020 and uses Difference-in-Difference for analysis. The empirical results show that among different types of agricultural products, livestock and poultry rose the most, at 6.6%, and grain and oil rose the least, at 0.3%. From the perspective of residents' income and geographic area, the prices of agricultural products in Chengdu have risen overall, and the price fluctuations are greatest in areas with small agricultural production values. The research in this article is helpful to understand the agricultural product price adjustment mechanism under the impact of the epidemic, and provides decision-making reference for effective formulation of relevant policies to stabilize prices and ease the pressure on residents' lives. © 2021 IEEE.","Adjustment mechanism; Agricultural product prices; Decision-making reference; Difference-in-Difference; Novel coronavirus pneumonia","Agricultural robots; Decision making; Grain (agricultural product); Agricultural productions; Difference-in-differences; Domestic research; Geographic areas; Income effects; Price fluctuation; Price of agricultural products; Product price; Costs","","","","","","","Su M., Zhao F., Li C., Feng B., Analysis of China's price situation and macro fiscal policy [J], Review of Economic Research, 2013, 19, pp. 9-26; Chen Y., Ma Y., Macro-prudential supervision: Objectives, tools and related institutional arrangements [J], Economic Theory and Business Management, 2012, 3, pp. 5-15; Huang W., Thoughts on the application of cobweb divergence model theory in Chinese agriculture [J], Agricultural Economy, 2006, 3, pp. 28-30; Zhang L., Zhang H., International oil prices, alternative fuels, and world food prices: An analysis of the transmission mechanism based on the alternative model of exhaustible resource technology [J], World Economy Studies, 2009, 6, pp. 13-18+25+87; Dong X., Shuai W., Zhao Z., An empirical study on the impact of oil price changes on China's food prices [J], China Soft Science, 2014, 10, pp. 129-143; Guo X., Ge D., Research on the characteristics of China's agricultural product price [J], Journal of Anhui Agricultural Sciences, 37, 19, pp. 9153-9155, (2009); Gu G., Fang C., Analysis on the characteristics of China's agricultural product price volatility-based on the situation transfer model under the influence of international market factors [J], Chinese Rural Economy, 2010, 6, pp. 67-76; Zhou J., Zhang J., Analysis of the reasons for the price rise of agricultural products in China and agricultural policy [J], Journal of Jiangxi University OfFinance and Economics, 2008, 4, pp. 60-63; Sun J., Novel coronavirus pneumonia and global governance reform [J], World Economics and Politics, 2020, 5, pp. 71-95","Q.

Establishment of a cell, tissue or organ culture and regeneration of plantlets under in vitro conditions has opened up new avenues in the area of plant biotechnology. Micropropagation is one such method where the plants are grown under in vitro conditions to provide a better survival rate and mass propagation in a short time, it is achieved through the establishment of the explants and their initial growth in vitro, followed by transferring them onto the field or in a greenhouse. This has triggered a great interest in understanding plant physiology and performing a comprehensive study regarding the change in physiology and morphology under influence of various useful bacterial combinations. In this review, plant growth promoting rizobacteria (PGPR) were used in the bio priming of the micro propagated plants (banana), these plants showed increased growth of the root length; shoot length, internode diameter and number of leaves. All parts of the banana plant have medicinal applications: the flowers in bronchitis and dysentery and on ulcers; cooked flowers are given to diabetics; the astringent plant sap in cases of hysteria, epilepsy, leprosy, fevers, hemorrhages, acute dysentery and diarrhea, and it is applied on hemorrhoids, insect and other stings and bites; young leaves are placed as poultices on burns and other skin afflictions; the astringent ashes of the unripe peel and of the leaves are taken in dysentery and diarrhea and used for treating malignant ulcers; the roots are administered in digestive disorders, dysentery and other ailments; banana seed mucilage is given in cases of diarrhea in India. The changes in protein expression as a consequence of environmental stimuli were evaluated which led to the conclusion that the bio hardened plants showed high protein content but had the similar genetic content when compared against the control plants. Thus increase in the protein content enhances these medicinal qualities of banana plant. Further, a fidelity test was conducted on the bio primed plants to check the genetic variations. © 2015, The Author(s).","Biopriming; In vitro culture; Micropropagation; PGPR","Agriculture; Diseases; Fruits; Physiology; Plant life extension; Proteins; Seed; Tissue; Tissue regeneration; Agricultural robots; Plants (botany); Bio primings; Environmental stimuli; In-vitro; Medicinal applications; Micropropagated plants; Micropropagation; PGPR; Plant growth promoting; Endophytic bacteria; Industrial chemistry; Medicinal qualities; Protein expressions; Plants (botany); Seed","","","","","","","Rani V., Raina S.N., Genetic fidelity of organized meristem-derived micropropagated plants: A critical reappraisal, Vitro Cell Dev Biol Plant, 36, 5, pp. 319-330, (2000); Aitken-Christie J., Connett M., Micropropagation of forest trees, Transplant Production Systems, pp. 163-194, (1992); Harish S., Kavino M., Kumar N., Saravanakumar D., Soorianathasundaram K., Samiyappan R., Biohardening with plant growth promoting rhizosphere and endophytic bacteria induces systemic resistance against banana bunchy top virus, Appl Soil Ecol, 39, 2, pp. 187-200, (2008); Thakker J.N., Patel S., Dhandhukia P.C., Induction of defense-related enzymesin susceptible variety of banana: Role of Fusarium derived elicitors, Achieves Phytopathol Plant Prot, 44, 20, pp. 1976-1984, (2011); Ayyadurai N., Ravindra Naik P., Sreehari Rao M., Sunish Kumar R., Samrat S.K., Manohar M., Sakthivel N., Isolation and characterization of a novel banana rhizosphere bacterium as fungal antagonist and microbial adjuvant in micropropagation of banana, J Appl Microbiol, 100, 5, pp. 926-937, (2006); Del Carmen Jaizme-Vega M., Rodriguez-Romero A.S., Guerra M., Potential use of rhizobacteria from the Bacillus genus to stimulate the plant growth of micropropagated bananas, Cambridge J, 59, 2, pp. 83-90, (2004); Mahmood M., Rahman Z.A., Saud H.M., Shamsuddin Z.H., Subramaniam S., Influence of rhizobacterial and agrobacterial inoculation on selected physiological and biochemical changes of banana cultivar, Berangan (AAA) plantlets, J Agric Sci, 2, 1, (2010); Esitken A., Use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in horticultural crops, Bacteria Agrobiology Crop Ecosyst, pp. 189-235, (2011); Panigrahi S., Aruna Lakshmi K., Bathina S., A biological approach to harden the micropropagated plants using the soil Microorganisms, Micro Macro Nutr Anal Helix, 3, pp. 324-327, (2013); Panigrahi S., Aruna Lakshmi K., Mir N., Micropropagation and plant strengthening of tissue cultured plants, inoculated with several bacterial strains, IJSR, 2, 8, pp. 15-17, (2013); Panigrahi S., Aruna Lakshmi K., Fidelity testing, an approach to ensure the genomic stability of the biologically hardened micropropagated plants, IJSER, 7, pp. 145-149, (2013); Alvarez C.E., Ortega A., Fernandez M., Borges A.A., Growth, yield and leaf nutrient content of organically grown banana plants in the Canary islands, Fruits, 56, pp. 17-26, (2001); Clendennen S.K., May G.D., Differential gene expression in ripening banana fruit, Plant Physiol, 115, 2, pp. 463-469, (1997); Dominguez-Puigjaner E., Vendrell M., Ludevid D.M., Differential protein accumulation in banana fruit during ripening, Plant Physiol, 98, 1, pp. 157-162, (1992)","S.

We demonstrate an approach applied to poultry products that allows picking up a whole chicken from an unordered bin using a suction cup gripper, estimating its pose using a Deep Learning approach, and placing it in a canonical orientation where it can be further processed. Our robotic system was experimentally evaluated and is able to generalize to object variations and achieves high accuracy on bin picking and pose estimation tasks in a real-world environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

These data support decision-making by the farmer (e.g. management of ventilation and heating). PLF uses modern information and communication technologies to exchange, transform and provide feedback to the farmer. PLF can also involve the use of automatic systems and robots which relieve the farmer of certain tedious tasks. Soon, the farmer will be able to manage production, health, behaviour and welfare parameters of the flock in real time. A major issue is to learn from the multiple data generated and utilise it to create and develop appropriate livestock management tools for the farmer. Smartphone applications used outside the agricultural sector will be presented as examples of technology which can be transferred to the poultry sector. This prospect will make it possible to identify new approaches for the future of the poultry sector. The digital revolution provides an opportunity to rethink production systems. This revolution will encourage and facilitate communication between parties (product traceability and transparency among stakeholders). PLF technologies generate a huge amount of data, with various formats and sources. The challenges are to share these data between stakeholders and improve the statistical processing of big data to design and develop new management tools for the farmers. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Most of the industries already started adopting the “connected” culture for expounding their products or services. Things or Sensors are not new to this world. The real utilization of sensor or things will be determined only by its real usage and increasing the business value. Poultry farming is one of the greatest contributor for our country’s GDP (i.e. Agriculture’s contribution). This paper explains how effectively technology like IOT, Imagery analytics helps the farmer to control & reduce the bird’s mortality rate, recommendation on medicine dosage for birds by remote monitoring. The doctors or bird specialist who leverage advanced analytics (i.e. Imagery analytics) to decide the bird’s health and probable recommendation for medicines to control the mortality and disease spreading across poultry. Images taken from the poultry will be stored in an unstructured store with its supporting metadata and data. The algorithmic imagery models will help to identify the deficiencies and recommend the dosages according to the color and stains in different parts of the bird’s body. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Data lake; Field sensors; Hadoop; Image frames; Imagery models; Internet of things (IOT); Machine learning","Advanced Analytics; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Birds; Disease control; Service industry; Business value; Disease monitoring; Disease spreading; Medicine dosage; Mortality rate; Real time; Remote monitoring; Internet of things","","","","","","","Int.
