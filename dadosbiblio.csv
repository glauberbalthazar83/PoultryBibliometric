FOR LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY FARMING, INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS RELATED TO FEED ADDITIVES ARE ESPECIALLY RELEVANT. A VALUABLE PHYTOGENIC ADDITIVE TO THE FEED RATIONS OF FARM ANIMALS AND POULTRY IS HYDROPONIC GREEN FODDER OBTAINED BY GERMINATING SEEDS. OFF-SEASON OBTAINING OF GREEN FORAGE ON A HYDROPONIC BASIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES OF THERMAL AND ELECTRICAL ENERGY, IN CONNECTION WITH WHICH THE URGENT TASK IS TO REDUCE THE ENERGY INTENSITY OF PRODUCTION. TO INCREASE THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF GREEN FODDER PRODUCTION, IT IS PROPOSED TO CREATE THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR THE SEEDS TO REALIZE THEIR POTENTIAL WITH THE HELP OF METHODS AND MEANS OF ELECTRICAL TECHNOLOGY, WHICH MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REALIZE \"SMART\"(CONTROLLED) GERMINATION AND TO INFLUENCE THE BIOELECTRIC POTENTIALS OF SEEDS DUE TO THEIR ELECTRIFICATION. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDIES CARRIED OUT, THE MAXIMUM CHARGE RECEIVED BY GERMINATING SEEDS OF LEGUMES IN THE CORONA DISCHARGE FIELD WAS DETERMINED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ELECTRIFICATION OF GERMINATING SEEDS PROMOTES THE ACTIVATION OF GROWTH PROCESSES, AN INCREASE IN THE YIELD AND QUALITY OF HYDROPONIC GREEN FORAGE, AND A DECREASE IN THE ENERGY INTENSITY OF ITS PRODUCTION. © PUBLISHED UNDER LICENCE BY IOP PUBLISHING LTD.";"";"ADDITIVES; BIOELECTRIC POTENTIALS; ELECTRIC CORONA; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS; SEED; AGRO-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX; CORONA DISCHARGES; ELECTRICAL ENERGY; ELECTRICAL TECHNOLOGY; ELECTROTECHNOLOGIES; GERMINATING SEEDS; INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS; PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY; ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL EFFECTS";"";"";"MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE OF RUSSIA (M.: NRU HSE) FORECAST OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FOR THE PERIOD UP TO 2030 140, (2017); FEED AND FEED ADDITIVES; POPKOV N A, ET AL., FEED AND BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE SUBSTANCES, (2005); KU Y G, KANG D H, LEE C K, LEE S Y, RYU C S, KIM D E, POLOVKA M, NAMIESNIK J, GORINSTEIN S; LESHCHENKO G P, SAZONOV K A, LESHCHENKO E A, DEPENDENCE OF THE INTENSITY OF ELECTRIC INFLUENCE ON THE STAGE OF SPRING OF SEEDS, PP. 87-92, (2017); LESHCHENKO G P, SAZONOV K A, TORBEEV I G, ELECTRODE SYSTEMS FOR PROCESSING BIO-OBJECTS HEAT AND GAS SUPPLY FOR AGRICULTURE ED P G SVECHNIKOV, PP. 28-33, (2015); LESHCHENKO G P, BASARYGINA E M, CHEREPUKHINA S V, LESHCHENKO E A, PUTILOVA T A, INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING, MANAGEMENT, & APPLIED SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIE, (2020); KRUGLYAKOV YU A, EQUIPMENT FOR THE CONTINUOUS CULTIVATION OF GREEN FEED HYDROPONICALLY, (1991); PROKHOROV A M, PHYSICAL ENCYCLOPEDIC DICTIONARY, (1984); YAVORSKY B M, DETLAF A A, LEBEDEV A K, PHYSICS HANDBOOK FOR ENGINEERS AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, (2008); LESHCHENKO G P, IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF HYDROPONIC GREEN FODDER CULTIVATION BY TREATING GERMINATING SEEDS IN CONSTANT ELECTRIC FIELDS (CHELYABINSK), 192, (2006); EMELYANOV A M, ET AL., BUREAU OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION (YEKATERINBURG) THE USE OF SAPROPELS IN AGRICULTURE, (2002); DOSPEKHOV B A, FIELD EXPERIMENT TECHNIQUE (WITH THE BASICS OF STATISTICAL PROCESSING OF RESEARCH RESULTS), (2011)";"E.M.

IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY AND PARTICULARITY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL ROBOT TECHNOLOGY, IT IS OF GREAT VALUE TO SUMMARIZE ITS DEVELOPMENT CHARACTERISTICS AND MAKE REASONABLE JUDGMENTS ON ITS DEVELOPMENT TREND. IN THIS PAPER, THE TYPE OF AGRICULTURAL ROBOT SYSTEMS WAS FIRST DISCUSSED. FROM THE CLASSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURAL ROBOT SYSTEMS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAIN TYPES OF MONITORING ROBOTS, NON-SELECTIVE AND SELECTIVE WORKING ROBOTS FOR CROP FARMING, LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY FARMING AND AQUACULTURE WERE INTRODUCED IN DETAIL. THEN THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, CORE TECHNOLOGY, AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS WERE SUMMARIZED. IT IS BELIEVED THAT NAVIGATION IN COMPLEX AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS, DAMAGE-FREE ROBOT-CROP INTERACTION, AND AGRONOMY-ROBOT FUSION HAVE HIGH SCIENTIFIC VALUE AND SIGNIFICANCE TO PROMOTE THE REVOLUTIONARY ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURAL ROBOT TECHNOLOGY. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF INTER-DISCIPLINE BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL ROBOT TECHNOLOGY AND NEW MATERIALS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, BIONICS, AGRONOMY ARE RESEARCH FOCUS. THE FAST DAMAGE-FREE OPERATION, AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION FOR COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS, TARGET DETECTION FOR COMPLEX BACKGROUNDS, AND SPECIAL DESIGN FOR AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE KEY TECHNOLOGY OF AGRICULTURAL ROBOT DEVELOPMENT, AND THE DEVELOPMENT PATH IS GIVEN. FINALLY, ROBOT-CROP INTERACTION SIMULATION, BIG DATA SUPPORT, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ARE REGARDED AS PATHS TO REALIZE THE BREAKTHROUGH OF KEY AGRICULTURAL ROBOT TECHNOLOGIES. THE SUMMARY AND PROSPECT OF THIS PAPER ARE OF POSITIVE SIGNIFICANCE TO PROMOTE THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL ROBOT TECHNOLOGY. © 2021, CHINESE SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING.

PROTEIN NUTRITION ISSUES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED QUICKLY, BOTH IN PROTEIN PRODUCTION AND IN RATIONAL USE. UNBALANCED DIETS FOR PROTEIN INHIBITS THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG ANIMALS, DISRUPTS METABOLISM, INCREASES FEED CONSUMPTION PER UNIT OF PRODUCTION, THEREBY INCREASING ITS COST. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THE USE OF NON-TRADITIONAL PROTEIN FEEDS OF LOCAL PRODUCTION AND THE CREATION OF NEW RECIPES FOR ENERGY-PROTEIN CONCENTRATES AS FULL-FLEDGED COMPONENTS OF COMPOUND FEEDS HAS BECOME ONE OF THE TASKS OF THE KALININGRAD RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURE-A BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL RESEARCH CENTER ALL-RUSSIAN INSTITUTE OF FEED NAMED AFTER V. R. WILLIAMS. THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN WORKING ON THE PROBLEM OF PROTEIN DEFICIENCY SINCE 2000. SHE STARTED AT THE FEDERAL STATE UNITARY ENTERPRISE \"NOVONIKOLAEVSKOE\"IN THE BALAKOVSKY DISTRICT OF THE SARATOV REGION WITH SCIENTISTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL FEEDING AT THE VAVILOV STATE AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY: DOCTORS OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES ALEXANDER PETROVICH KOROBOV, SERGEY PETROVICH MOSKALENKO, ALEXEY ALEKSEEVICH VASILIEV, AND CONTINUED FROM 2009 TO THE PRESENT AT THE KALININGRAD RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS DATA ON FEEDING CALVES (2013-2019) AND QUAILS (2019) ENERGY-PROTEIN CONCENTRATE BASED ON EXTRUDED GRAIN OF NARROW-LEAVED LUPINE, INSTEAD OF SOY, SUBJECTED TO HEAT TREATMENT ON A PRESS EXTRUDER AS PART OF COMPOUND FEED; DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF THE CONCENTRATE ON CHANGING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF CALVES AND QUAILS. CALVES WERE FED LUPINE CONCENTRATE WITH A SHELL, QUAILS WITHOUT A SHELL WITH THE ADDITION OF AN ENZYME PREPARATION. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE FEED VALUE OF THE EXTRUDED CONCENTRATE BASED ON LUPINE IS NOT INFERIOR TO THE EXTRUDED CONCENTRATE BASED ON SOY AND ALLOWS YOU TO GET GOOD GAINS IN LIVE WEIGHT OF ANIMALS AND POULTRY. CONCENTRATE BASED ON LUPINE, WITH THE ADDITION OF ENZYMES IN BIOLOGICAL VALUE IS EQUAL TO FULL-FAT SOY.  © PUBLISHED UNDER LICENCE BY IOP PUBLISHING LTD.";"";"AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; ANIMALS; ENZYMES; FEEDING; FOOD SUPPLY; HEAT TREATMENT; NUTRITION; AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH; AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE; BIOLOGICAL VALUES; ENZYME PREPARATION; GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT; PROTEIN CONCENTRATES; PROTEIN PRODUCTION; RESEARCH INSTITUTES; GRAIN (AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT)";"";"";"ARTYUKHOV A., GAPONOV N., LUPIN-A VALUABLE SOURCE OF PROTEIN IN COMPOUND FEEDS, PP. 65-66, (2010); ARTYUKHOV A., VASHCHEKIN E., EFIMENKO E., KADYROV F., MENKOVA A., RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PRACTICAL USE OF FEED FROM NARROW-LEAVED LUPINE IN THE DIETS OF FARM ANIMALS (BRYANSK), 55, (2009); RECOMMENDATIONS, (2001); ALEKSEYEV E., FEED LUPINS: SB, (1959); KOSOLAPOV V.

HOWEVER, THE MEASUREMENT OF CONCENTRATIONS OF AIRBORNE POLLUTANTS IN LIVESTOCK BUILDINGS IS GENERALLY QUITE DIFFICULT. TO COUNTER THIS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTONOMOUS ROBOT THAT COULD COLLECT KEY ENVIRONMENTAL DATA CONTINUOUSLY IN LIVESTOCK BUILDINGS WAS INITIATED. THIS RESEARCH PRESENTS A SPECIFIC PART OF THE LARGER STUDY THAT FOCUSED ON THE PRELIMINARY LABORATORY TEST FOR EVALUATING THE NAVIGATION PRECISION OF THE ROBOT BEING DEVELOPED UNDER THE DIFFERENT GROUND SURFACE CONDITIONS AND DIFFERENT LOCALIZATION ALGORITHM ACCORDING INTERNAL SENSORS. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ROBOT WAS SUCH THAT EACH WHEEL OF THE ROBOT WAS DRIVEN BY AN INDEPENDENT DC MOTOR WITH FOUR ODOMETERS FIXED ON EACH MOTOR. THE INERTIAL MEASUREMENT UNIT (IMU) WAS RIGIDLY FIXED ON THE ROBOT VEHICLE PLATFORM. THE RESEARCH FOCUSED ON USING THE INTERNAL SENSORS TO CALCULATE THE ROBOT POSITION (X, Y, Θ) THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT METHODS. THE FIRST METHOD RELIED ONLY ON ODOMETER DEAD RECKONING (ODR), THE SECOND METHOD WAS THE COMBINATION OF ODOMETER AND GYROSCOPE DATA DEAD RECKONING (OGDR) AND THE LAST METHOD WAS BASED ON KALMAN FILTER DATA FUSION ALGORITHM (KFDF). A SERIES OF TESTS WERE COMPLETED TO GENERATE THE ROBOT’S TRAJECTORY AND ANALYSE THE LOCALISATION ACCURACY. THESE TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF SURFACES AND PATH PROFILES. THE RESULTS PROVED THAT THE ODR CALCULATION OF THE POSITION OF THE ROBOT IS INACCURATE DUE TO THE CUMULATIVE ERRORS AND THE LARGE DEVIATION OF THE HEADING ANGLE ESTIMATE. HOWEVER, IMPROVED USE OF THE GYROSCOPE DATA OF THE IMU SENSOR IMPROVED THE ACCURACY OF THE ROBOT HEADING ANGLE ESTIMATE. THE KFDF CALCULATION RESULTED IN A BETTER HEADING ANGLE ESTIMATE THAN THE ODR OR OGDR CALCULATIONS. THE GROUND TYPE WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE AN INFLUENCING FACTOR OF LOCALISATION ERRORS. © 2016, CHINESE SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING.

IN SUCH APPLICATION SETTINGS, THE ROBOTS INITIALLY SEARCH AND EXPLORE THE ENTIRE WORKSPACE TO FIND THE TARGETS, SO THAT THE SUBSEQUENT ROBOTS CONVENIENTLY MOVE DIRECTLY TO THE TARGETS TO FULFILL THE TASK. A MULTI-LAYER ROBOT NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NECESSARY FOR SLR OPERATIONS. THE SCENARIO OF INTEREST IS THE REMOVAL OF BROILER MORTALITY BY AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS IN POULTRY BARNS IN THIS PAPER. DAILY MANUAL COLLECTION OF BROILER MORTALITY IS TIME-AND LABOR-CONSUMING, AND AN AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC SYSTEM CAN SOLVE THIS ISSUE EFFECTIVELY. IN THIS PAPER, A MULTI-LAYER NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DEVELOPED TO DETECT AND REMOVE BROILER MORTALITY WITH TWO ROBOTS. ONE ROBOT IS ASSIGNED TO SEARCH A LARGE-SCALE WORKSPACE IN A COVERAGE MODE AND FIND AND LOCATE OBJECTS, WHEREAS THE SECOND ROBOT DIRECTLY MOVES TO THE LOCATED TARGETS TO REMOVE THE OBJECTS. DIRECTED COVERAGE PATH PLANNING (DCPP) FUSED WITH AN INFORMATIVE PLANNING PROTOCOL (IPP) IS PROPOSED TO EFFICIENTLY SEARCH THE ENTIRE WORKSPACE. IPP IS PROPOSED FOR COVERAGE DIRECTIONS IN DCPP DEVOTED TO RAPIDLY ACHIEVING SPATIAL COVERAGE WITH THE LEAST ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY IN THE DECOMPOSED GRIDS. THE DETECTION ROBOT CONSISTS OF A DEVELOPED INFORMATIVE-BASED DIRECTED COVERAGE PATH PLANNER AND A YOU ONLY LOOK ONCE (YOLO) V4-BASED DEAD BIRD DETECTOR. IT REFINES AND OPTIMIZES THE COVERAGE PATH BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA ON BROILER MORTALITY DISTRIBUTION IN A BROILER BARN. THE REMOVAL ROBOT COLLECTS DEAD BROILERS DRIVEN BY A NEW HUB-BASED MULTI-TARGET PATH ROUTING (HMTR) SCHEME, WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO ROW-BASED ENVIRONMENTS. THE PROPOSED METHODS SHOW GREAT POTENTIAL TO NAVIGATE IN BROILER BARNS EF-FICIENTLY AND SAFELY, THUS BEING A USEFUL COMPONENT FOR ROBOTICS. THE EFFECTIVENESS AND ROBUSTNESS OF THE PROPOSED METHODS ARE VALIDATED THROUGH SIMULATION AND COMPARISON STUDIES. © THE AUTHOR(S) 2022.";"BROILER MORTALITY; DIRECTED COVERAGE PATH PLANNING; HUB-BASED MULTI-TARGET ROUTING (HMTR) SCHEME;

THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE 'GRIBBOT' - A NOVEL 3D VISION-GUIDED ROBOTIC CONCEPT FOR FRONT HALF CHICKEN HARVESTING. IT FUNCTIONS USING A COMPLIANT MULTIFUNCTIONAL GRIPPER TOOL THAT GRASPS AND HOLDS THE FILLET, SCRAPES THE CARCASS, AND RELEASES THE FILLET USING A DOWNWARD PULLING MOTION. THE GRIPPER HAS TWO MAIN COMPONENTS; A BEAK AND A SUPPORTING PLATE. THE BEAK SCRAPES THE FILLET DOWN THE RIB CAGE OF THE CARCASS FOLLOWING A PATH DETERMINED BY THE ANATOMICAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE MEAT AND THE BONE OF THE RIB CAGE. THE SUPPORTING PLATE IS ACTUATED PNEUMATICALLY IN ORDER TO HOLD THE FILLET. A COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHM WAS DEVELOPED TO PROCESS IMAGES FROM AN RGB-D CAMERA (KINECT V2) AND LOCATE THE GRASPING POINT IN 3D AS THE INITIAL CONTACT POINT OF THE GRIPPER WITH THE CHICKEN CARCASS FOR HARVESTING OPERATION. CALIBRATION OF CAMERA AND ROBOT WAS PERFORMED SO THAT THE GRASPING POINT WAS DEFINED USING 3D COORDINATES WITHIN THE ROBOT'S BASE COORDINATE FRAME AND TOOL CENTRE POINT. A FEED-FORWARD LOOK-AND-MOVE CONTROL ALGORITHM WAS USED TO CONTROL THE ROBOT ARM AND GENERATE THE MOTION TRAJECTORIES, BASED ON THE 3D COORDINATES OF THE GRASPING POINT AS CALCULATED FROM THE COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHM. THE RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENTAL PROOF-OF-CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION SHOWED THAT GRIBBOT WAS SUCCESSFUL BOTH IN SCRAPING THE CARCASS, GRASPING CHICKEN FILLETS AUTOMATICALLY AND IN COMPLETING THE FRONT HALF FILLET HARVESTING PROCESS. IT DEMONSTRATED A POTENTIAL FOR THE FLEXIBLE ROBOTIC AUTOMATION OF THE CHICKEN FILLET HARVESTING OPERATION. ITS COMMERCIAL APPLICATION, WITH FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, CAN RESULT IN AUTOMATED FILLET HARVESTING, WHILE FUTURE RESEARCH MAY ALSO LEAD TO OPTIMAL RAW MATERIAL UTILISATION. GRIBBOT SHOWS THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL TO AUTOMATE EVEN THE MOST CHALLENGING PROCESSING OPERATIONS CURRENTLY CARRIED OUT MANUALLY BY HUMAN OPERATORS. © 2015 ELSEVIER B.V..";"CHICKEN; FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION; GRIPPER; HARVESTING; ROBOT; VISUAL SERVOING";"NORWAY; ALGORITHMS; ANIMALS; AUTOMATION; CAMERAS; GRIPPERS; HARVESTING; ROBOTICS; ROBOTS; VISUAL SERVOING; CHICKEN; COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS; COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS; FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION; HARVESTING OPERATIONS; INITIAL CONTACT POINT; PROCESSING OPERATIONS; PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY; ALGORITHM; BONE; CALIBRATION; COMPUTER VISION; COORDINATE; HARVESTING; IMAGE ANALYSIS; MEAT; PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; POULTRY; RESEARCH WORK; ROBOTICS; COMPUTER VISION";"THE RESEARCH COUNCIL OF NORWAY, (225349/E40)";"THE AUTHORS GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE RESEARCH COUNCIL OF NORWAY AS PART OF THE CYCLE ( HTTP://CYCLEWEB.NO/ ) RESEARCH PROJECT (225349/E40).

POULTRY FARMERS FREQUENTLY HAVE TO OVERCOME EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS TO MAINTAIN THEIR CHICKENS' WELLBEING. PRIOR RESEARCH HAS PROPOSED AUTOMATING POULTRY FARMING ACTIVITIES TO CONTROL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (E.G., TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY). HOWEVER, THESE INTERVENTIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED, IN THIS CONTEXT, TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WOULD WORK AND PARTICIPANTS' PERCEPTIONS. FURTHER, CHICKEN COOPS IN SSA HAVE DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS THAT WOULD MAKE TECHNOLOGY AUTOMATION DIFFICULT. TO EXPLORE HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE WORKED WITH LOCAL COLLABORATORS TO DESIGN AND DEPLOY \"NKHUKUPROBE\"- A LOW-COST SENSOR-BASED TECHNOLOGY THAT POULTRY FARMERS CAN INTERACT WITH VIA USSD (UNSTRUCTURED SUPPLEMENTARY SERVICE DATA) TO MONITOR AND ADJUST CHICKEN COOP CONDITIONS. FIRST, WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF RELATED WORK ON POULTRY FARMING IN SSA AND A PILOT STUDY WITH POULTRY FARMING EXPERTS. FINDINGS FROM THIS WORK GUIDED THE DESIGN OF NKHUKUPROBE. THEN, WE DEPLOYED NKHUKUPROBE IN 15 MALAWIAN HOUSEHOLDS FOR ONE MONTH. THE GOALS OF OUR DEPLOYMENT WERE TO UNDERSTAND PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES USING NKHUKUPROBE AND TO LEARN ABOUT OTHER WAYS OF USING SENSORS IN THIS CONTEXT. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE USED INTERVIEW, DIARY, OBSERVATION AND DATA LOGGING TO COLLECT DATA THROUGHOUT THE DEPLOYMENT. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A TECHNOLOGY PROBE'S APPROACH UNVEILED DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR USING SENSORS TO SUPPORT POULTRY FARMING IN SSA. FURTHER, NKHUKUPROBE MOTIVATED PARTICIPANTS TO THINK OF OTHER WAYS OF USING SENSORS. WE PRESENT DESIGN IMPLICATIONS BASED ON THESE FINDINGS AND OFFER NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN SUPPORTING POULTRY FARMING ACTIVITIES. © 2021 ACM.";"DOMESTIC TECHNOLOGY; MALAWI; POULTRY; SENSORS";"AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; AGRICULTURE; ANIMALS; DATA ACQUISITION; PROBES; DOMESTIC TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS; FARMING ACTIVITIES; INCOME GENERATING ACTIVITIES; LOW-COST SENSORS; MALAWI; SUB-SAHARAN; SUPPLEMENTARY SERVICES; TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITIES; WELLBEING; HUMIDITY CONTROL";"MARY LOUISE GEPHART; MIDWESTERN STATE UNIVERSITY, MSU";"THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL TO RESPONDENTS, LOCAL TECHNICIANS, AND RESEARCH ASSISTANTS FOR THEIR TIME.

IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AUTONOMOUS MOBILE ROBOT DEVELOPED BY THE AUTHORS TO STUDY GROUP BEHAVIOUR OF CHICKS OF THE DOMESTIC CHICKEN (GALLUS GALLUS DOMESTICUS). WE DISCUSS THE DESIGN OF THE ROBOT AND OF THE EXPERIMENTAL FRAMEWORK THAT WE BUILT TO RUN ANIMAL–ROBOT EXPERIMENTS. THE ROBOT DESIGN WAS EXPERIMENTALLY VALIDATED, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ROBOT CAN BE SOCIALLY INTEGRATED INTO ANIMAL GROUPS. THE DESIGNED SYSTEM EXTENDS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART IN THE FIELD OF ANIMAL–ROBOT INTERACTION IN GENERAL AND THE BIRDS STUDY IN PARTICULAR BY COMBINING SUCH ADVANTAGES AS (1) THE ROBOT BEING A PART OF THE GROUP, (2) THE POSSIBILITY OF MIXED MULTI-ROBOT, MULTI-ANIMAL GROUPS, AND (3) CLOSE-LOOP CONTROL OF ROBOTS. IT OPENS NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STUDY OF BEHAVIOUR IN DOMESTIC FOWL BY USING MOBILE ROBOTS; BEING SOCIALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE ANIMAL GROUP, ROBOTS CAN PROFIT FROM THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK MECHANISM THAT PLAYS KEY ROLES IN ANIMAL COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOUR.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF THE OPERATION OF ROBOTS IN A POULTRY GROW-OUT HOUSE ENVIRONMENT IS FEASIBLE FROM AN ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PERSPECTIVE. TO DETERMINE THIS, AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED OPERATING BOTH AN AERIAL AND A GROUND ROBOT IN A SMALL-SCALE GROW-OUT HOUSE HOUSING BROILER CHICKENS FOR A TYPICAL GROWTH CYCLE (6 WEEKS). HUMANS ALSO INTERACTED WITH THE FLOCK DAILY. THE ENVIRONMENT AND ROBOTS WERE EQUIPPED WITH CAMERAS AND OTHER SENSORS TO RECORD DATA FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF THE EXPERIMENT. AS A PART OF THIS RESEARCH EFFORT, THE TEAM HAD TO ESTABLISH A SET OF MEASURABLE METRICS WITH WHICH TO BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. GIVEN THE UNIQUE SCENARIO AND DATA COLLECTION ABILITIES, A SET OF THREE MEASURABLE METRICS WITH WHICH TO QUANTITATIVELY ASSESS THE IMPACT OF OPERATING THE ROBOTS WAS CREATED. THESE METRICS INCLUDED AVOIDANCE DISTANCE, SPEED WHEN AVOIDING, AND RECOVERY TIME. EACH OF THE NEWLY DEFINED METRICS CAN BE EVALUATED USING STATISTICS AND MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, A SOFTWARE PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED TO ASSIST IN THE ANALYSIS OF THESE METRICS. THE AVOIDANCE DISTANCE METRIC IS DEFINED AS THE AVERAGE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CHICKEN AND THE EXTERNAL STIMULI, WHETHER IT BE HUMANS OR THE ROBOT SYSTEMS, AS IT MOVES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE. THE FLIGHT RESPONSE METRIC IS DEFINED AS THE ANIMAL RESPONSE RUNNING AWAY FROM EXTERNAL STIMULI. THE MASS OF MOVEMENT, THEIR AVERAGE SPEED, AND DISTANCE OF TRAVEL CAN ALL BE QUANTITATIVELY CHARACTERIZED. FINALLY, THE RECOVERY TIME METRIC IS DEFINED AS THE AVERAGE TIME IT TAKES BEFORE THE CHICKEN RESUME \"NORMAL\" ACTIVITY AFTER THE STIMULUS LEAVES THE ENVIRONMENT. A SOFTWARE TOOL WAS DEVELOPED TO ASSIST IN THE ANALYSIS OF THESE METRICS USING VIDEO RECORDINGS. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THERE ARE STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES IN THE AVERAGE AVOIDANCE DISTANCE METRIC BUT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AVERAGE SPEEDS, OR WITH THE RECOVERY TIME METRIC, INDICATING THAT OPERATING ROBOTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS NO MORE STRESSFUL TO THE CHICKEN THAN THE PRESENCE OF A HUMAN. A STUDY ON THE ABILITY OF THESE METRICS FOR IDENTIFYING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOR AND WHAT THEY POTENTIALLY MEAN IS PRESENTED HEREIN.

ATTEMPTS TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF COCONUT MEAL INCLUDED IN THE BROILER FEED HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGH AMINO ACIDS SUPPLEMENTATION, ENZYME ADDITION AND PELLETING COCONUT MEAL. AMONG THESE FEED TECHNOLOGIES AND MANIPULATION, PELLETING COCONUT MEAL APPEARS TO BE MORE POWERFUL IN PROMOTING THE GROWTH OF BROILER CHICKENS. THE REASONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF BROILER GROWTH DUE TO PELLETING COCONUT MEAL HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED YET. THE MECHANISMS OF IMPROVED GROWTH OF BIRDS MIGHT BE THROUGH INCREASED FEED INTAKE, LESS ENERGY SPENT AND INCREASED BULK DENSITY. COCONUT MEAL CONTAINS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF MANNOSE - BASED POLYSACCHARIDES OR MANNAN. THIS SUBSTANCE HAS LONG BEEN BELIEVED TO HAVE PREBIOTIC PROPERTIES DUE TO ITS CAPABILITY TO BIND CERTAIN SPECIES OF PATHOGENIC BACTERIA IN THE DIGESTIVE TRACT OF BIRDS. VOLUMINOUS REPORTS OF THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF MANNOSE-BASED POLYSACCHARIDES FROM YEAST HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. MANNOSE -BASED POLYSACCHARIDES FROM LEGUMES, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE ANTI-NUTRIENT PROPERTY. SURPRISINGLY, MANNOSE-BASED POLYSACCHARIDES FROM COCONUT BEHAVE LIKE YEAST MANNAN. A NUMBER OF CURRENT STUDIES INDICATED THAT MANNOSE BASED POLYSACCHARIDES IMPROVED BODY WEIGHT GAIN AND FEED DIGESTIBILITY. THE GROWTH OF BIRDS WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WHEN THE BIRDS WERE CHALLENGED AGAINST PATHOGENIC BACTERIA OF E. COLI. WET DROPPINGS AND DIARRHEA INCIDENCES WERE NOT FOUND IN E. COLI-CHALLENGED BIRDS WHEN THE DIETS WERE SUPPLEMENTED WITH COCONUT MANNAN. IN CONCLUSIONS, COCONUT MEAL CAN BE USED AS A FEED INGREDIENT FOR POULTRY UNLESS THE COCONUT MEAL WAS PELLETED OR ENZYMATICALLY TREATED. MANNOSE-BASED POLYSACCHARIDE FROM COCONUT WAS EFFECTIVE TO PROMOTE GROWTH AND ACTED AS PREBIOTIC. © PUBLISHED UNDER LICENCE BY IOP PUBLISHING LTD.";"";"AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; AGRICULTURAL WASTES; BIRDS; ESCHERICHIA COLI; NUTRITION; PELLETIZING; YEAST; AGRICULTURAL BY-PRODUCTS; BROILER CHICKENS; BROILER FEEDS; DIGESTIVE TRACT; FEED INGREDIENTS; FIBRE CONTENT; LOW QUALITIES; PATHOGENIC BACTERIUM; POLYSACCHARIDES";"";"";"FAOSTAT AGRICULTURE DATA, (2017); SUNDU B., HATTA U., CHAUDHRY A.S., POTENTIAL USE OF BETA MANNAN FROM COPRA MEAL AS A FEED ADDITIVE FOR BROILERS, WORLDS POULT.

THE POULTRY MEAT BRANCH WAS CHOSEN AS THE OBJECT OF RESEARCH. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DYNAMICALLY DEVELOPING SECTORS OF AGRICULTURE IN RUSSIA MODIFIED LOCALIZATION COEFFICIENTS WERE USED AS A METHOD FOR DETECTING THE TERRITORIAL CONCENTRATION OF THE SECTOR. THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE OUTPUT OF POULTRY MEAT PRODUCTS WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE TERRITORY OF 12 REGIONS OF RUSSIA THE LARGEST LOCALIZATION OF POULTRY FARMING IS IN THE CENTER OF THE EUROPEAN PART OF THE COUNTRY, NEAR LARGE CITIES. THE LEVEL OF TERRITORIAL CONCENTRATION OF THE POULTRY MEAT SECTOR INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PERIOD OF 2004-2017. THE LOCALIZATION COEFFICIENTS OF THE REGIONS THAT SPECIALIZE IN POULTRY MEAT PRODUCTION HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED. THERE IS AN INCREASE IN \"POLARITY\" IN THE SPECIALIZATION OF REGIONS. SOME REGIONS CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF POULTRY MEAT, THE LEVEL OF REGIONAL SPECIALIZATION IS GROWING. IN OTHER REGIONS, POULTRY PRODUCTION IS DECLINING.

IN THIS CONTEXT, MOTION, SLIP, AND TRACTIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE ROBOTS WERE COMPARED BASED ON THE STUDENT'S T-TEST FOR TIRE AIR PRESSURE OF 20.68–55.16 KPA AND ROBOT FORWARD SPEED OF 0.17–0.5 M/S. RESULTS INDICATE THAT MOTION EFFICIENCY OF THE TRACKED ROBOT (93.27–95.12%) WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF THE WHEELED ROBOT (94.52–99.31%) WITH NORMAL AND MAXIMUM TIRE AIR PRESSURE. MOREOVER, SLIP EFFICIENCY OF THE TRACKED ROBOT (89.25–91.73%) WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE WHEELED ROBOT (80.94–89.74%) IN ALL DRAWBAR WORKS. TRACTIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE TRACKED ROBOT (83.02–87.10%) WAS ALSO HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE WHEELED ROBOT (80.17–84.60%) IN ALMOST ALL DRAWBAR WORKS. THUS, IT CAN BE POINTED OUT THAT THE TRACKED ROBOT OUTPERFORMED THAN THE WHEELED ROBOT IN TERM OF TRACTION PERFORMANCE. GENERALLY, NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL DESCRIPTIONS ARE APPLICABLE FOR THE RESEARCHERS INTERESTED IN IMPROVEMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF LOCOMOTION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE OF GROUND MOBILE ROBOTS IN AGRICULTURAL DRAWBAR WORKS.

PRECISION LANDING CONTROL OF UAV IS CRITICAL FOR APPLICATION OF IT IN SOME SPECIFIC AREAS SUCH AS GREENHOUSES OR LIVESTOCK/POULTRY HOUSES. FOR CONTROLLING UAV LANDING ON A FIXED OR MOBILE APRON/PLATFORM ACCURATELY, THIS STUDY PROPOSED AN AUTOMATIC METHOD AND TESTED IT UNDER THREE SCENARIOS: (1) UAV LANDING AT HIGH OPERATING ALTITUDE BASED ON THE GPS SIGNAL OF THE MOBILE APRON; (2) UAV LANDING AT LOW OPERATING ALTITUDE BASED ON THE IMAGE RECOGNITION ON THE MOBILE APRON; AND (3) UAV LANDING PROGRESS CONTROL BASED ON THE FIXED LANDING DEVICE AND IMAGE DETECTION TO ACHIEVE A STABLE LANDING ACTION. TO VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED CONTROL METHOD, APRON AT BOTH STATIONARY AND MOBILE (E.G., 3 KM/H MOVING SPEED) STATUSES WERE TESTED. BESIDES, A SIMULATION WAS CONDUCTED FOR THE UAV LANDING ON A FIXED APRON BY USING A COMMERCIAL POULTRY HOUSE AS A MODEL (135 L × 15 W × 3 H M). RESULTS SHOW THAT THE AVERAGE LANDING ERRORS IN HIGH ALTITUDE AND LOW ALTITUDE CAN BE CONTROLLED WITHIN 6.78 CM AND 13.29 CM, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE POULTRY HOUSE SIMULATION, THE LANDING ERRORS WERE 6.22 ± 2.59 CM, 6.79 ± 3.26 CM, AND 7.14 ± 2.41CM AT THE RUNNING SPEED OF 2 KM/H, 3 KM/H, AND 4 KM/H, RESPECTIVELY. THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR APPLYING THE UAV IN AGRICULTURAL FACILITIES SUCH AS POULTRY OR ANIMAL HOUSES WHERE REQUIRES A STRICTER LANDING CONTROL THAN OPEN FIELDS. © 2020 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO IDENTIFY THE INDONESIA'S BROILERS BUSINESS FACING WITH OVERSUPPLY DIFFICULTIES AND ITS EVOLUTION. METHODS OF INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYZES WERE DESCRIPTIVE, ANALYTICAL OR ASSESSMENT BASED ON EVIDENCE FROM THE EXISTING CONDITION OF THE INDONESIA'S BROILERS BUSINESS AND ITS EVOLUTION. INDONESIA'S POULTRY SECTOR CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE STRONG GROWTH, DESPITE INDUSTRY REPORTS OF OVERSUPPLY. THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN SOME EFFORTS TO REGULATE THE IMPORT OF BREEDER STOCK IN ORDER TO SLOW GROWTH AND STRENGTHEN PRICES, ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS ARE NEGLIGIBLE. ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY CONDUCTED BY MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE BASED ON MONITORING OF MARKET INFORMATION SERVICE ON JUNE 25, 2019, THE AVERAGE PRICE PER KG LIVE BIRD (LB) IN THE NATIONAL IS IDR 20,216, WHILE THE AVERAGE PRICE ON JAVA ISLAND IS AROUND IDR 11,327, AND LB PRICES IN CENTRAL JAVA AND EAST JAVA ARE ONLY AROUND IDR 8,845 AND IDR 10,736. THE FALL IN THE PRICE OF BROILERS MEAT IN JAVA, DUE TO NOT ALL OF MEAT PRODUCED IS ABSORBED IN TRADITIONAL MARKETS. THIS SITUATION OCCURS BECAUSE THE BROILER FARMERS PREDICTS THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN DEMAND AFTER PERIOD OF EID AL-FITR CELEBRATION, IT TURNED OUT THAT SUCH CONDITIONS DID NOT OCCUR SO THE PRODUCT BECOMES ABUNDANT AND FINALLY THE PRICE DOWN. © PUBLISHED UNDER LICENCE BY IOP PUBLISHING LTD.";"";"AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; AGRICULTURE; ANIMALS; COMMERCE; COSTS; FACINGS; INFORMATION SERVICES; BROILER INDUSTRY; INDONESIA; POULTRY MEAT; POULTRY SECTOR; SLOW GROWTH; STRONG GROWTH; TRADITIONAL MARKETS; MEATS";"";"";"MINISTRY OF TRADE I., KAJIAN KEBIJAKAN PERSAINGAN USAHA DI SEKTOR PERUNGGASAN.

AS DISASTERS, HEALTH, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE BECOME PART OF PLANNING CONCERN (MATTHEW & MCDONALD, 2007), GREATER FOCUS ON HOUSEHOLD INFRASTRUCTURE AND EID DISEASE OUTBREAKS AMONG POULTRY IS WARRANTED. FOLLOWING SPENCER (2013), THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MIX OF HOUSEHOLD-SCALE WATER SUPPLIES, SANITATION SYSTEMS, AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, AND HIGHLY PATHOGENIC AVIAN INFLUENZA (HPAI) AMONG POULTRY IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY: VIETNAM. FINDINGS OF OUR MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS SUGGEST THAT A NON-LINEAR, KUZNETS-SHAPED URBAN TRANSITION (SPENCER, 2013) HAS AN INDEPENDENT EFFECT ON THE OUTBREAK OF HPAI, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL SANITATION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE KUZNETS-SHAPE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSEHOLD INFRASTRUCTURE CHARACTERISTICS IN VIETNAM PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN EXPLAINING WHERE POULTRY OUTBREAKS OCCUR. USING SECONDARY DATA FROM THE CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, AND THE AGRICULTURAL CENSUS AT THE DISTRICT AND COMMUNE LEVELS FOR THE COUNTRY OF VIETNAM, WE PERFORMED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO TEST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUTBREAKS OF HPAI IN POULTRY AND NEWLY-DEVELOPED “COHERENCE INDICES” (SPENCER, 2013) OF HOUSEHOLD WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION, AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS THAT MEASURE NONLINEAR, TRANSITIONAL DEVELOPMENT. RESULTS SHOW THAT DISTRICT-SCALE COHERENCE INDICES ARE NEGATIVELY AND INDEPENDENTLY CORRELATED WITH HPAI OUTBREAKS, ESPECIALLY FOR SANITATION. FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST THAT COMMUNITY-SCALE COHERENCE OF URBAN INFRASTRUCTURES IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR PREDICTING WHERE HPAI POULTRY OUTBREAKS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR, THEREBY PROVIDING HEALTH PLANNERS NEW TOOLS FOR EFFICIENT SURVEILLANCE. © 2019 ELSEVIER B.V.";"AVIAN INFLUENZA; COHERENCE INDEX; EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE; HOUSEHOLD INFRASTRUCTURE; THE BUILT LANDSCAPE; URBAN TRANSITION; VIET NAM";"VIET NAM; ANIMALIA; AVES; AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; LOGISTIC REGRESSION; POPULATION STATISTICS; SANITATION; SURVEYS; WATER SUPPLY; AVIAN INFLUENZA; EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE; HOUSEHOLD INFRASTRUCTURE; THE BUILT LANDSCAPE; URBAN TRANSITION; VIET NAM; AVIAN INFLUENZA; DEVELOPING WORLD; INDEX METHOD; INFECTIOUS DISEASE; INFRASTRUCTURE; POULTRY; REGRESSION ANALYSIS; SANITATION; URBAN PLANNING; DISEASES";"HA NOI UNIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURE; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF; DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, BIO, (0909410)";"THE DATA DISCUSSED HERE WERE MADE POSSIBLE BY NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRANT # 0909410 , UNDER THE COUPLED HUMAN-NATURAL SYSTEMS PROGRAM AND FACILITATED THROUGH CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH VIET NAM’S HA NOI UNIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURE.

THE POULTRY VISCERA WERE GRABBED BY THE MANIPULATION WITH THE GUIDANCE OF MACHINE VISION TECHNOLOGY. A MACHINE-VISION-BASED METHOD OF LOCATING THE VISCERA OF POULTRY CARCASSES WAS DESCRIBED. THE THRESHOLD SEGMENTATION METHOD, SOBEL OPERATOR AND IMAGE OPERATIONS WERE USED TO SEGMENT THE IMAGES OF POULTRY VISCERA. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE VISCERAL CONTOUR WAS EXTRACTED AND ITS POSITION WAS DETECTED FOR COMMON POULTRY SUCH AS THREE-YELLOW CHICKEN. THE IDENTIFICATION RATES OF THIS VISCERAL CONTOUR RECOGNITION SYSTEM WERE 95.3%, SUGGESTING THAT THE PROPOSED IMAGE RECOGNITION ALGORITHM COULD ACHIEVE THE ACCURACY REQUIRED FOR POULTRY VISCERAL CONTOUR DETECTION.

IN A TRADITIONAL POULTRY HOUSE, BREEDERS MUST USUALLY OBSERVE THE HEALTH OF THE BROILERS IN PERSON ON THE BASIS OF THEIR BREEDING EXPERIENCE AT REGULAR TIMES EVERY DAY. WHEN A BREEDER FINDS UNHEALTHY BROILERS, THEY ARE REMOVED MANUALLY FROM THE POULTRY HOUSE TO PREVENT VIRUSES FROM SPREADING IN THE POULTRY HOUSE. THEREFORE, IN THIS STUDY, WE DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED A NOVEL SMALL REMOVAL SYSTEM FOR DEAD CHICKENS FOR TAIWANESE POULTRY HOUSES. IN THE MECHANICAL DESIGN, THIS SYSTEM MAINLY CONTAINS WALKING, REMOVAL, AND STORAGE PARTS. IT COMPRISES ROBOTIC ARMS WITH A FIXED END AND SWEEP-IN DEVICES FOR SWEEPING DEAD CHICKENS, A CONVEYOR BELT FOR TRANSPORTING CHICKENS, A STORAGE CACHE FOR STORING CHICKENS, AND A TRACKED VEHICLE. THE DESIGNED SYSTEM HAS DIMENSIONS OF APPROXIMATELY 1.038 × 0.36 × 0.5 M3, AND TWO DEAD CHICKENS CAN BE REMOVED IN A SINGLE OPERATION. THE WALKING SPEED OF THE CHICKEN REMOVAL SYSTEM IS 3.3 CM/S. IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE AUTOMATION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE POULTRY INDUSTRY, THE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM WAS USED IN A NOVEL SMALL REMOVAL SYSTEM. THE CONDITIONS OF THE CHICKENS IN A POULTRY HOUSE CAN BE MONITORED REMOTELY BY USING A CAMERA, AND DEAD CHICKENS CAN BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH DEEP LEARNING BASED ON THE YOLO V4 ALGORITHM. THE PRECISION OF THE DESIGNED SYSTEM REACHED 95.24% IN THIS STUDY, AND DEAD CHICKENS WERE SUCCESSFULLY MOVED TO THE STORAGE CACHE. FINALLY, THE DESIGNED SYSTEM CAN REDUCE THE CONTACT BETWEEN HUMANS AND POULTRY TO EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE OVERALL BIOLOGICAL SAFETY. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE ROBOT SYSTEM WAS COMPOSED OF FOUR PARTS, INCLUDING A CARRYING VEHICLE, SPRAYING UNIT, ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS AND A CONTROLLER. TWO OPERATING MODES WERE SUPPORTED, FULLY AUTOMATIC AND REMOTE CONTROL. FOR THE LOW-LIGHT AND LESS-IRRITATION CONDITIONS IN LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY HOUSE, A 'MAGNET-RFID' PATH DETECTION NAVIGATION METHOD WAS PROPOSED TO ACHIEVE AUTONOMOUS MOVEMENT ALONG THE LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY CAGES. THE AIR-ASSISTED LIQUID SPRAY NOZZLE WAS DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE SIMULTANEOUS ATOMIZATION AND DIFFUSION OF THE DISINFECTANT LIQUID. A FLUID DYNAMICS SIMULATION OF THE AIR FLOW FIELD IN THE NOZZLE CAVITY WAS PERFORMED TO OPTIMIZE THE STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS OF ITS COMPONENTS. THE INCLINATION ANGLES OF THE CONICAL INFUSION BLOCK AND THE ATOMIZATION GRID WERE DETERMINED TO BE 75° AND 90°, RESPECTIVELY. FINALLY, THE ROBOT'S NAVIGATION AND SPRAYING PERFORMANCE WERE TESTED IN THE LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY HOUSE. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ROBOT'S VEHICLE COULD AUTOMATICALLY NAVIGATE AT THE SPEED OF 0.1∼0.5 M/S, AND THE MAXIMAL DEVIATION DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ACTUAL TRAJECTORY AND THE EXPECTED PATH WAS 50.8 MM. AND THE ROBOT CAN SPRAY LIQUID DISINFECTANT AT A FLOW RATE OF 200∼400 ML/MIN, FORMING DROPLETS WITH A DIAMETER (DV.9) OF 51.82∼137.23 ΜM AND A DEPOSITION DENSITY OF 116-149 DROP PER CM2.

AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS A GRADUAL PROCESS OF INCREASING THE LOAD ON THE SYSTEM OVER TIME WHICH LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN POWER LOSS IN POWER TRANSMISSION LINES AND THE APPEARANCE OF ADDITIONAL ENERGY SOURCES WITHIN THE EXISTING NETWORK. THE CHAPTER ANALYZES THE EFFECT OF INTEGRATION OF DISTRIBUTED PRODUCTION ON POWER LOSSES IN POWER SUPPLY LINES WITH THE DISTRIBUTED LOAD. THE POWER SUPPLY SYSTEMS OF POULTRY FARMS WERE ANALYZED AS THE OBJECTS OF THE RESEARCH. THE PECULIARITY OF THE PRESENT SCHEME OF CONNECTION OF ADDITIONAL POWER SOURCES BASED ON PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL ADDITIONAL POWER SOURCES CONNECTED TO THE OPTIMAL PLACES OF JOINING LOADS FOR REDUCING LOSSES IN THE SUPPLY LINE. THE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF LOSS REDUCTION IN COMPARISON WITH THE INITIAL LINE WITH THE OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF POWER AND PLACES OF CONNECTION OF ADDITIONAL SOURCES ARE ANALYZED. THERE WAS FOUND THE MAXIMUM LEVEL OF LOSS REDUCTION FOR ANY GIVEN NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL POWER SUPPLIES. THE PROPOSED METHOD OF CALCULATION OF THE CONNECTION OF POWER SOURCES ON THE BASIS OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS ALLOWS TO DETERMINE THE DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF OPTIMAL POWER AND CONNECTION POINTS BY THE OBTAINED ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS. TO REDUCE THE CALCULATIONS, THERE WAS PRESENTED THE NOMOGRAM FOR DETERMINING VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF DISTANCES TO THE CONNECTION POINT AND CAPACITIES OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS WITH MINIMAL LOSSES IN THE POWER SUPPLY LINE. © SPRINGER NATURE SINGAPORE PTE LTD 2020.";"ACTIVE POWER; ADDITIONAL SOURCE; DISTRIBUTED LOAD; OPTIMAL CONNECTION POINT; PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM; POWER LOSS";"DISTRIBUTED COMPUTER SYSTEMS; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS; ROBOTICS; ACTIVE POWER; ADDITIONAL SOURCE; CONNECTION POINTS; DISTRIBUTED LOADS; PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS; POWER-LOSSES; ELECTRIC LOAD LOSS";"";"";"JUNXIA M., BINQING G., FUCHAO L., PEIDONG D., STUDY ON POWER LOSS OF DISTRIBUTION NETWORK WITH DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND ITS REACTIVE POWER OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM, INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON POWER SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY, PP. 1213-1216, (2014); ATWA Y.M., EL-SAADANY E.F., RELIABILITY EVALUATION FOR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WITH RENEWABLE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION DURING ISLANDED MODE OF OPERATION, IEEE TRANS.

IN THIS CASE, THE TECHNIQUE IS ONLY RESOLVED WHEN THE CONDITIONS FOR PROVIDING THE REQUIRED TEMPERATURE AND AIR SPEED PARAMETERS ARE MET. IF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MODULE TIN CHANGES FROM 16 °C TO 35 °C, AND INFLOW AIR SPEED VARIES FROM 0.2 M/S TO 0.3 M/S, THE INFRARED HEATING SYSTEM AND THE VENTILATION SYSTEM COMPLETELY PROVIDE THE NORMALIZED AIR TEMPERATURE IN THE IRRADIATION AREA. BASED ON AN ALGORITHM USING A DEVELOPED TECHNIQUE A COMPUTER PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS, THROUGH THE USE OF A SIMPLE METHOD OF SUBSTITUTING INPUT FACTORS, TO DETERMINE THE PARAMETERS OF THE TEMPERATURE REGIME OF THE MODULE FOR POULTRY BREEDING. © 2021, SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.";"ENGINEERING CALCULATION; EXHAUST OUTLET; INFRARED HEATER; MODULE FOUR POULTRY BREEDING; THERMAL POWER";"AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; HEATING EQUIPMENT; VENTILATION; AIR TEMPERATURE; ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES; INFRARED HEATERS; INPUT FACTORS; POULTRY HOUSE; TEMPERATURE PARAMETERS; TEMPERATURE REGIMES; VENTILATION SYSTEMS; INFRARED HEATING";"";"";"UKRAINE’S ENERGY STRATEGY FOR THE PERIOD UP TO 2030; KOCAMAN B., ESENBUGA N., YILDIZ A., LACIN E., MACIT M., EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN POULTRY HOUSES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF LAYING HENS, INT.

DESPITE THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IMPLEMENTED, THE SECTOR STILL HAS A GENERALLY LOW LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL MATURITY COMPARED WITH OTHER SECTORS. INDUSTRY 4.0 STRONGLY FOCUSES ON SMART MANUFACTURING, INCLUDING SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES AND TECHNOLOGIES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO IDENTIFY INDUSTRY 4.0 APPROACHES (TECHNOLOGIES, PROJECTED BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO INDUSTRY 4.0) AND MAIN APPLICABILITIES IN THE BROILER MEAT PRODUCTION CHAIN IN THE POULTRY SECTOR. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF LITERATURE WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE DATABASES, USING FORMAL PROTOCOLS FOR ORDERING AND SELECTING BIBLIOGRAPHIC MATERIALS. TWO TOPICS WERE INCLUDED: GENERAL IMPLEMENTATIONS IN INDUSTRY 4.0 AND INDUSTRY 4.0 IN THE POULTRY SECTOR (BROILER PRODUCTION CHAIN). OVERALL, THE BENEFITS OF INDUSTRY 4.0 ARE INHERENT TO THE ECONOMIC DIMENSION, WITH A CERTAIN PREDISPOSITION TO INTEGRATED DIMENSIONS (ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL). THE MAIN BARRIERS TO INDUSTRY 4.0, ALSO KNOWN AS INHIBITING FACTORS, ARE HIGH INVESTMENTS, THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE (GENERALLY OR THROUGH METHODS OR TECHNICAL PROCEDURES), UNCERTAINTIES IN RESULTS, AND CHALLENGES IN QUALIFYING HUMAN CAPITAL. REGARDING INDUSTRY 4.0 TECHNOLOGIES, THE MOST EMPLOYED IN THE BROILER PRODUCTION CHAIN (AVIARIES AND SLAUGHTERHOUSES, MAINLY) ARE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ROBOTS AND/OR SOFTWARE), BIG DATA ANALYTICS AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT). © 2023 WORLD’S POULTRY SCIENCE ASSOCIATION.";"INDUSTRY 4.0;

AS A MATTER OF FACT, HEALTH BEHAVIOR SUCH AS DEAD OR SICK CAN LEAD TO HIGHER INFECTIOUS RATE AND POOR HEALTH OF PEOPLE, HENCE, IT HAS A MAIN IMPACT ON THE WHOLE LIVESTOCK HEALTH SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE AUTOMATIC MONITORING OF DEAD OR SICK POULTRY, A METHOD OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR RECOGNITION BASED ON COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY IS PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY. THE COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON THE CLASS LIBRARIES MFC AND THE COMPUTER VISION LIBRARIES OPENCV, AND IT CAN PROVIDE A EFFECTIVE ALGORITHM TO IDENTIFY THE HEALTH BEHAVIOR. THIS ALGORITHM IS BASED ON YELLOW FEATURE EXTRACTION AND \"AND\" OPERATION. TO IDENTIFY THE YELLOW FEATURE, B∗ OF THE L∗A∗B∗ COLOR SPACE IS TAKEN AS CHARACTERISTIC QUANTITY, THE HISTOGRAM EQUALIZATION METHOD IS ADOPTED TO IMPROVE IMAGE QUALITY. OTSU METHOD IS USED AS THE SEGMENTATION CRITERION, THE NOISE IS REMOVED EFFECTIVELY BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL OPERATION, AND THIS ALGORITHM IS PROPOSED ACCORDING TO THE JUDGMENT STANDARD THAT WHETHER THE NUMBERS OF LAYERS' LEG FEATURE IN THE PROCESS OF IMAGE-PROCESSING ARE CONSISTENT WITH ACTUAL SITUATION. THE EXPERIMENTAL SAMPLES WERE 100 GROUPS LAYERS THAT WERE 50 WEEKS OLD, THREE OR FOUR LAYERS WERE PLACED IN THE CAGE, AND THE LAYER'S FEATURE WAS COLLECTED BY VISION SYSTEM THAT CONSISTED OF A CMOS CAMERA, A MOBILE VEHICLE, COMPUTER AND CONTROLLER. THE FIELD OF EACH PICTURE TAKEN BY CAMERA SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE WIDTH OF ONE WHOLE CAGE. THE TOTAL SUCCESS RATE OF RECOGNIZABLE LAYERS' HEALTH BEHAVIOUR IS 86%, WHICH DEMONSTRATES THIS ALGORITHM IS FEASIBLE. THIS STUDY CAN BE USED TO GUIDE THE DESIGN OF AUTOMATIC BIOLOGY MONITORING ROBOT.

INTELLIGENT INFORMATION PERCEPTION IDEAS FOR DIFFERENT APPLICATION SCENARIOS ARE STIMULATED WITH THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF SENSORS, INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGIES AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES WORLDWIDE. INTELLIGENT PERCEPTION OF INFORMATION IN THE POULTRY FARMING PROCESS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE LIBERATION OF LABOR, SAFEGUARDING ANIMAL WELFARE, AND IMPROVING THE AUTOMATION AND EFFICIENCY OF POULTRY FARMING. IN THIS REVIEW, THE INFORMATION PERCEPTION FRAMEWORK IN MODERN POULTRY FARMING HAS BEEN ANALYZED TO FULLY ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF INFORMATION PERCEPTION IN MODERN POULTRY FARMING. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE REVIEWED THE RESEARCH OF INFORMATION PERCEPTION TECHNOLOGY IN POULTRY FARMING IN 26 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT RESEARCH GOALS, IT IS MAINLY DIVIDED INTO FIVE ASPECTS: INDIVIDUAL POULTRY TARGET PERCEPTION, BEHAVIOR RECOGNITION, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, AND BREEDING-RELATED ROBOTS. SOME TABLES ARE PROVIDED TO SUMMARIZE AND REVIEW RESEARCH INFORMATION ON DIFFERENT TOPICS. WE FOUND THAT FOR THE INFORMATION PERCEPTION IN POULTRY BREEDING, MANY CHALLENGES STILL NEED TO BE SOLVED, SUCH AS THE ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF POULTRY INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION IN COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT, MULTI-SCALE MONITORING OF POULTRY HOUSE ENVIRONMENT, INTELLIGENT DISEASE DIAGNOSIS AND EXCEPTION HANDLING, ROBOT FUNCTION EXPANSION AND MULTI-ROBOT COORDINATION. TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF ACCURATE, EFFICIENT, AND INTELLIGENT PERCEPTION OF INFORMATION IN THE UNMANNED POULTRY FARMING SYSTEM, WE HAVE ALSO POINTED OUT THE FUTURE RESEARCH FOCUS AND DEVELOPMENT TRENDS RESPECTIVELY BY COMBINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. © 2022";"INTELLIGENT INFORMATION PERCEPTION; POULTRY; PRECISION POULTRY FARMING; UNMANNED POULTRY FARMING SYSTEM";"ANIMALS; BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH; COORDINATION REACTIONS; INTELLIGENT ROBOTS; ANIMAL HUSBANDRY; APPLICATION SCENARIO; FARMING SYSTEM; INFORMATION PERCEPTION; INTELLIGENT INFORMATION; INTELLIGENT INFORMATION PERCEPTION; INTELLIGENT PERCEPTION; PRECISION POULTRY FARMING; SENSOR INFORMATIONS; UNMANNED POULTRY FARMING SYSTEM; AUTOMATION; COMMUNICATION; DISEASE; INFORMATION PROCESSING; LIVESTOCK FARMING; PERCEPTION; POULTRY; ROBOTICS; DIAGNOSIS";"KEY R&D PROGRAM OF ZHEJIANG PROVINCE, (2021C02026)";"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE KEY R&D PROGRAM OF ZHEJIANG PROVINCE (NO. 2021C02026).

THE ROBOT SYSTEM IS COMPOSED OF FOUR COMPONENTS, NAMELY THE AUTOMATIC BEARING VEHICLE, THE DISINFECTION SPRAYING UNIT, THE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING SENSORS, AND THE CONTROLLER. THE ROBOT SUPPORTS TWO WORKING MODES: FULLY AUTOMATIC MODE AND REMOTE CONTROL MODE. AIMING AT THE LOW-LIGHT AND LOW-STRESS CONDITION IN THE LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY HOUSES, THE METHOD FOR DETECTING NAVIGATION PATH BASED ON \"MAGNET-RFID\" MARKS IN THE GROUND WAS PROPOSED TO REALIZE THE ROBOT'S AUTOMATIC MOVING BETWEEN THE CAGES. IN VIEW OF THE LARGE-FLOW AND LONG-RANGE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DISINFECTANT'S SPRAYING, THE AIR-ASSISTED NOZZLE WAS DESIGNED, WHICH COULD ATOMIZE AND DISPERSE THE LIQUID INDEPENDENTLY. BASED ON THE CFD SIMULATION OF AIRFLOW IN THE NOZZLE, THE NOZZLE'S PARTS STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS WERE OPTIMIZED, AS THE ANGLE OF THE CONE-SHAPED GUIDE PAD AND THE INCLINATION ANGLE OF THE GRID RESPECTIVELY DETERMINED AS 75°AND 90°. FINALLY, THE ROBOT'S PERFORMANCE WAS TESTED IN A POULTRY HOUSE IN BEIJING. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT, THE ROBOT'S MOBILE PLATFORM COULD AUTOMATICALLY NAVIGATE AT THE SPEED OF 0.1－0.5 M/S, AND THE MAXIMAL DEVIATION DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ACTUAL TRAJECTORY AND THE EXPECTED PATH WAS 50.8 MM. THE AIR-ASSISTED NOZZLE COULD REALIZE THE ATOMIZATION AND DIFFUSION OF THE LIQUID MEDICINE AT THE SAME TIME, AND WAS SUITABLE FOR SPRAYING THE LIQUID MEDICINE WITH A FLOW RATE OF 200－400 ML/MIN. THE DIAMETER (DV.9) OF THE LIQUID DROPLETS FORMED WAS 51.82－137.23 ΜL, AND BECAME LARGER AS THE FLOW RATE OF THE LIQUID MEDICINE INCREASED. THE DEPOSITION DENSITY OF SPRAY DROPLETS FORMED BY THE NOZZLE WAS 116－149/CM2, AND DECREASED AS THE SPRAY DISTANCE INCREASED.

TO PROVIDE THE POPULATION WITH MEAT, MILK, AND WOOL, THE VOLUME OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTS IS INCREASING, WHICH ENTAILS THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORAGE PRODUCTION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEED PRODUCTION IS POSSIBLE BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND REDUCING THE COST OF FEED PRODUCTION. THE QUALITY CAN BE IMPROVED BY USING THE EXTRUSION METHOD, WHICH INCREASES THE DIGESTIBILITY AND NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF FEED. THE ADDITION OF SAPROPEL PROVIDES ANIMALS WITH VITAMINS AND MINERALS. AS A RESULT OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND ECONOMIC EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON BROILER CHICKENS, IT WAS FOUND THAT BIRDS THAT WERE FED WITH EXTRUDED SAPROPELE GRAIN HAD A GREATER WEIGHT GAIN. FOR THE PRODUCTION OF EXTRUDED SAPROPELIC FEED, AN EXTRUDER WITH A DOUBLE-ENTRY SCREW AND CONICAL COMPRESSION RINGS CAN BE USED. IT CAN REDUCE EXTRUSION LOSSES AND THE SCREW LENGTH. TO DETERMINE THE DESIGN PARAMETERS, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE PRESSURE CHANGE IN THE EXTRUDER ALONG THE SCREW LENGTH. HAVING ANALYZED THE MIXTURE MOVEMENT THROUGH THE ANNULAR CONICAL CHANNEL OF THE DIE AND BUILT AN EQUILIBRIUM EQUATION FOR THE ELEMENTARY SECTION, WE HAVE A MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR DETERMINING THE PRESSURE IN FRONT OF THE FORMING HEAD. IN A SIMILAR WAY, A MATHEMATICAL MODEL WAS BUILT TO DETERMINE THE PRESSING PRESSURE IN FRONT OF THE COMPRESSION SEAL. THE PAPER DESCRIBES MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIPS FOR DETERMINING THE PRESSURE AT ANY POINT IN THE EXTRUDER. USING THE MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIPS, DESIGN PARAMETERS THAT AFFECT THE PRESSURE IN THE EXTRUDER HAVE BEEN DETERMINED. © PUBLISHED UNDER LICENCE BY IOP PUBLISHING LTD.";"";"AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; AGRICULTURE; ANIMALS; EXTRUSION; SCREWS; COMPRESSION RINGS; COMPRESSION SEALS; DESIGN PARAMETERS; ECONOMIC EXPERIMENTS; EQUILIBRIUM EQUATION; MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP; NUTRITIONAL VALUE; QUALITY OF PRODUCT; EXTRUDERS";"";"";"BABAYAN I V, VASILEVA O A, VOLOSHUK L A, FEATURES OF DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE, BULLETIN OF THE ALTAI ACADEMY OF ECONOMICS AND LAW, 5, PP. 19-23, (2019); PRIPOROV I E, BACHU T N, TRENDS OF THE PROTEIN FEEDS PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENT, BULLETIN OF ORENBURG STATE AGRARIAN UNIVERSITY, 2, PP. 104-106, (2019); OTAROV A I, THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT TREATMENT OF GRAIN OF VARIOUS FORAGE CROPS ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF FATTENING GOBIES OF KALMYK BREED VETERINARY MEDICINE, ANIMAL SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY, 9, PP. 74-80, (2019); FATTAKHOVA Z F, SHAKIROV S K, KRUPIN E O, BIKCHANTAEV I T, SHAYAKHMETOVA L N, ASKAROVA A A, THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, NUTRITION AND FRACTIONAL COMPOSITION OF WINTER RYE GRAIN PROTEINS AFTER VARIOUS METHODS OF EXPOSURE, CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 1, PP. 71-79, (2020); PIETSCH V L, WERNER R, KARBSTEIN H P, EMIN M A, HIGH MOISTURE EXTRUSION OF WHEAT GLUTEN: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROCESS PARAMETERS, PROTEIN POLYMERIZATION, AND FINAL PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS, JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING, 259, PP. 3-11, (2019); TANGJAIDEE P, XIANG J, YIN H, WEN X, QUEK S Y, SELENIUM, FIBRE, AND PROTEIN ENRICHMENT OF RICE PRODUCT: EXTRUSION VARIABLES AND PRODUCT PROPERTIES, FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY, 1, PP. 40-51, (2019); IGNATENKOV V G, BOGDANOV K A, IVANOV E A, IVANOV A I, ALEKSANDROV D A, RESEARCH OF THE DRUM CELLULAR PERCENTAGE FEEDER WORKING OF A VITAMIN-FODDER ADDITIVE OF MULTI-PURPOSE GRINDING AND MIXING MACHINE BASED ON A SAPROPEL, BULLETIN OF KURGAN STATE AGRICULTURAL ACADEMY, 2, PP. 62-65, (2020); VASILEVA M I, BYCHKOVA K V, ARZHANKOVA YU V, IGNATENKOV V G, LIVE WEIGHT OF BROILER CHICKENS WHEN ADDED TO THE DIET OF EXTRUDED WHEAT SEPARATELY AND MIXED WITH SAPROPEL, IZVESTIA OF VELIKIE LUKI STATE AGRICULTURAL ACADEMY, 1, PP. 2-8, (2020); PRIPOROV I E, SHEPELEV A B, YAGYAEV E R, IMPROVEMENT OF EXTRUDERS FOR PREPARING PROTEIN FEED FROM SUNFLOWER SEEDS, BULLETIN OF ORENBURG STATE AGRARIAN UNIVERSITY, 2, PP. 145-148, (2020); PAKHOMOV V I, BRAGINETS S V, BAKHCHEVNIKOV O N, ALFEROV A S, RUDOY D V, EXTRUSION TECHNOLOGIES OF FEED AND FOOD INCLUDING BIOMASS OF INSECTS (REVIEW), AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE OF THE EURO-NORTH-EAST, 3, PP. 233-244, (2020); PAKHOMOV V I, BRAGINETS S V, BAKHCHEVNIKOV O N, ALFEROV A S, RUKHLYADA A I, BABAJANYAN A S, THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF EXTRUSION OF FEED CONTAINING WHEAT GRAIN AND BLACK SOLDIER FLY LARVAE BIOMASS, AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE OF THE EURO-NORTH-EAST, 1, PP. 28-42, (2020); FOMINYKH A V, MIKHAILYUK E N, FOMINA S V, KOVSHOVA N A, CALCULATION METHOD OF PNEUMATIC EXTRUDED SOYBEAN HANDLING INSTALLATION, BULLETIN OF KURGAN STATE AGRICULTURAL ACADEMY, 2, PP. 78-80, (2019); FOMINYKH A V, OVCHINNIKOV D N, FOMINA S V, PRODUCTION LINE OF FULL-FAT EXTRUDED SOYA WITH RECOVERY OF THE HEAT ENERGY, BULLETIN OF KURGAN STATE AGRICULTURAL ACADEMY, 3, PP. 83-85, (2014); SHISHKIN V V, MIKHALYEV V V, USANOV V S, FEED ADDITIVE PRODUCED BY EXTRUSION OF THE MINERAL-ENRICHED SOYBEANS: OPTIMIZATION OF HOMOGENEITY IN MIXING COMPONENTS, FAR EASTERN AGRARIAN BULLETIN, 3, PP. 199-205, (2017); GORB S S, TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESS OF EXTRUSION AND ANALYSIS OF MODERN DESIGNS FOR PRESS EXTRUDERS PREPARING CONCENTRATED FORAGE IN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, SCIENTIFIC LIFE, 2, PP. 98-103, (2019)";"";"IOP PUBLISHING LTD";"ENGLISH";"IOP CONF.

THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THE FEEDING ROBOT IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF CONCERN IN THE PROCESS OF PATH PLANNING. IN THIS STUDY, THE SHORTEST PATH DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE FEEDING ROBOT CONSUMES THE LEAST ENERGY, BECAUSE THE TOTAL MASS OF THE FEEDING ROBOT KEEPS CHANGING DURING THE FEEDING PROCESS. IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND THE MOST SUITABLE PATH SO THAT THE FEEDING ROBOT CONSUMES THE LOWEST AMOUNT OF ENERGY DURING THE FEEDING PROCESS. A BRANCH AND BOUND ALGORITHM TO CALCULATE THE MINIMUM ENERGY CONSUMPTION TRAVEL PATH FOR SMALL-SCALE BUCKETS LACKING FEED IS PROPOSED. THE LOWER BOUND OF THE BRANCH AND BOUND ON THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS OBTAINED BY THE APPROACH OF PREFERRED SELECTION OF THE SET OF SHORTEST EDGES COMBINED WITH THE SEQUENCE INEQUALITY, AND THE UPPER BOUND COULD BE OBTAINED BASED ON CHRISTOFIDES’S HEURISTIC ALGORITHM. A DOUBLE-CROSSOVER OPERATOR GENETIC ALGORITHM BASED ON AN UPPER BOUND ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR LARGE-SCALE BUCKETS LACKING FEED IS PROPOSED, AND DIFFERENT CROSSOVER OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FITNESS VALUE AND THE UPPER BOUND OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN ORDER TO FIND A BETTER PATH. THE EXPERIMENT RESULTS SHOW THAT THE APPROACH PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY IS EFFICIENT; FOR SMALL-SCALE BUCKETS LACKING FEED, A BRANCH AND BOUND ALGORITHM COULD CALCULATE THE MINIMUM ENERGY CONSUMPTION PATH OF 17 POINTS IN 300 S, AND FOR LARGE-SCALE BUCKETS LACKING FEED, A DOUBLE-CROSSOVER OPERATOR GENETIC ALGORITHM BASED ON AN UPPER BOUND ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION COULD CALCULATE THE MINIMUM ENERGY CONSUMPTION TRAVEL PATH WITHIN 30 POINTS IN 60 S.

THESE INVOLVE RAISING FARM ANIMALS IN DENSELY POPULATED ENVIRONMENT, COMMONLY TERMED AS A FACTORY LIVESTOCK FARMING. SUCH AN OPERATION IS ACTUALLY AIMED AT YIELDING A VERY LARGE SCALE OF FARM ANIMAL PRODUCTS BY MEANS OF INTENSIFICATION IN ANIMAL REARING SYSTEMS. THIS IS BECOMING A GLOBAL TREND IN PRACTICING FARM ANIMAL PRODUCTIONS NOWADAYS. THE TRANSFORMATION OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION FROM A FAMILY SMALL SCALE ANIMAL HUSBANDRY TO A LARGE SCALE OF CORPORATE BUSINESS HAS BEEN MAINLY DRIVEN BY THREE MAJOR INTERRELATED FACTORS, THESE ARE I) A PREDICTION ON A RAPID WORLD'S HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH, II) DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, PARTICULARLY AGE STRUCTURE AND URBANIZATION, AND III) SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS IMPROVEMENT. THE TOTAL WORLD'S POPULATION HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO REACH 9.1 BILLION IN 2050, WHERE 70 PERCENT OF RURAL INHABITANTS ARE GOING TO SHIFT MOSTLY LIVING IN URBAN AREAS AND WITH THEIR BETTER INCOMES THAN PREVIOUSLY EARNED AND ARE ALSO PREDICTED TO INCREASE BY 2 PERCENT ANNUALLY. INDICATIONS IN CHANGING URBAN LIFESTYLE HAS THEN BEEN SHOWN AFFECTING ON SHIFTED FOOD CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MORE TO SEMI-PROCESSED AND/OR PRE-PREPARED-READY TO EAT FOODS OF WHICH THEIR MAIN COMPONENT DERIVING FROM LIVESTOCK PRODUCT ORIGIN. AS THE TREND HAS BEEN COMMONLY SHOWN IN MANY URBAN AREAS, WHERE THEIR WORKING HOURS ARE BECOMING LONGER THAN THERE USED TO BE. IN AN ACTUAL FACT, THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES, PARTICULARLY IN REGIONS USED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SUCH AS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, SUB SAHARAN AFRICA, WEST ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA. CONSEQUENTLY, AN INCREASE RATE IN MEAT CONSUMPTION HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT OVER 4 PERCENT PER ANNUM. MOREOVER, THAT CHANGE HAS BECOME A SEQUENTIAL DRIVING FACTOR FOR THE RAPID GROWTH IN THE MEAT PRODUCTION SECTOR. AS HIGHER CONSUMER PREFERENCE IN CHICKEN MEAT THAN THAT IN OTHER TYPES, GLOBAL BROILER PRODUCTION IS HOLDING SUPREMACY OVER THE OTHER MEAT COMPLEX. A SPECIAL HIGHLIGHT ON BRUNEI DARUSSALAM POULTRY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED HERE, PARTICULARLY TO FOCUSING ON AN INDUSTRY DYNAMIC BASED ON DATA POSTED IN COUNTRY'S AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR OF 2013 [1]. AT THAT TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS REPORTED TO FULFIL ITS SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN CHICKEN MEAT WITH A CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA PER YEAR REACHED 58.5 KG. THE FIGURE WAS ACCOUNTED AS BEING THE SECOND HIGHEST CHICKEN MEAT CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA PER YEAR IN THE WORLD AFTER HONG KONG. IN LINE WITH THE GLOBAL TREND IN LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION, CONTINUOUS GROWING DEMANDS FOR THE PRODUCTS HAD ALSO LED TO INTENSIFICATION IN LIVESTOCK FARMING IN THE SOUTHEAST ASIA REGION. AS FAR AS THE FACTORY LIVESTOCK FARMING AS HAS GONE MORE COMMON OPERATIONS UP TO NOW, AND YET THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE AND MORE QUESTIONABLE ARGUMENTS OVER NEGATIVE IMPACTS ARISING, PARTICULARLY IN REGARDS TO ANIMAL WELFARE, HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATIONS WILL BE SEEMINGLY LEFT HARD TO ANSWER AS MOST VAST SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENTS REQUIRED, NONETHELESS THE MATTER MAY ONLY OPEN FOR DISCUSSIONS. © PUBLISHED UNDER LICENCE BY IOP PUBLISHING LTD.";"";"AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; ANIMALS; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; ECONOMICS; FOOD SUPPLY; MEATS; POPULATION DYNAMICS; POPULATION STATISTICS; BROILER PRODUCTIONS; CONSUMER PREFERENCES; DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS; EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT; HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH; LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; SEQUENTIAL DRIVING; SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS; AGRICULTURE";"";"";"DARUSSALAM DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE B., AGRIFOOD, AGRICULTURE AND AGRIFOOD STATISTCS IN BRIEF FOR THE YEAR OF 2013, (2013); THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008 YEAR IN REVIEW, OPEN KNOWL.

THESE CHALLENGES ARE FURTHER EXACERBATED BY A RAPIDLY GROWING DEMAND FOR FOOD PRODUCTION, LABOR SHORTAGES, AND A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THE PROCESS OF SEGMENTING A CHICKEN TO INDIVIDUAL, RETAIL PIECES IS QUITE INVOLVED, AND A KEY STEP IN THIS PIPELINE IS PLACING A PROCESSED CHICKEN ONTO SHACKLES. TRADITIONALLY, THIS IS PERFORMED BY HUMANS; HOWEVER, THE LACK OF A STEADY LABOR SUPPLY THREATENS THE THROUGHPUT OF THIS PROCESSING STEP. IN ORDER TO ENSURE FOOD SECURITY, CURRENT AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS, AND ONE SUCH TECHNOLOGY IS ROBOTICS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM THAT PERFORMS CHICKEN SHACKLING. THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A UNIVERSAL ROBOTS' UR5 MANIPULATOR, AN INTEL REALSENSE 435D RGB-D CAMERA, AND SEVERAL SOFTWARE COMPONENTS. THE CAMERA CAN PERCEIVE A WHOLE, DEFEATHERED CHICKEN PRODUCT IN A RANDOM INITIAL POSE AND ACCURATELY ESTIMATES THE POSITION AND ORIENTATION OF THE HOCK. THE UR5 MANIPULATOR THEN AUTONOMOUSLY GRABS THIS JOINT WITH A CUSTOM END EFFECTOR AND PLACES IT ONTO A SHACKLE. THIS TECHNOLOGY FURTHERS THE AUTOMATION OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY AND PUSHES THE APPLICATION OF ROBOTICS IN A SEMI-STRUCTURED AND DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT. © ASABE 2021 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL MEETING";"AUTOMATION; DEEP LEARNING; MACHINE VISION; POULTRY; REHANG; ROBOTICS";"AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; AGRICULTURE; ANIMALS; CAMERAS; COMPUTER VISION; EMPLOYMENT; FOOD SUPPLY; INDUSTRIAL MANIPULATORS; INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS; MANUFACTURE; MEATS; ROBOTICS; AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES; AUTOMATED SYSTEMS; FOOD INDUSTRIES; LABOR SHORTAGES; POSITION AND ORIENTATIONS; PROCESSING STEPS; SEMI-STRUCTURED; SOFTWARE COMPONENT; MANIPULATORS";"";"";"COLEMAN D., SUCAN I., CHITTA S., CORRELL N., REDUCING THE BARRIER TO ENTRY OF COMPLEX ROBOTIC SOFTWARE: A MOVEIT!

THE PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR THIS PAPER WAS IMPLEMENTED USING THE RASPBERRY PI 4 ALONG WITH ARDUINO UNOS, WHICH WAS ADAPTED TO BETTER SUIT THE NEEDS OF THE PAPER. THE SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO COLLECT DATA FROM SENSORS MEASURING VARIABLES SUCH AS AMMONIA, CARBON DIOXIDE, TEMPERATURE, AND HUMIDITY. THE WELLBEING OF THE CHICKEN CAN BE MONITORED THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES BEING SENSED. BASED ON STUDIES, DEVIATIONS IN THESE VARIABLES FROM THE BASELINE CAN INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF DISEASE. SOME SYSTEMS ALSO LISTEN TO SOUNDS TO UNDERSTAND IF ILLNESSES ARE PREVALENT. THE DATA WILL BE PASSED THROUGH A SERIES OF CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF INFECTION WITHIN THE FARM. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES THROUGH SIMULATIONS WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE MOBILE ROBOT CONNECTED WITH SENSORS.

MODERN BROILER PRODUCTION IN LARGE SHEDS HOLDING UPWARDS OF 50 000 BIRDS USES INDOOR CLIMATE CONTROL BASED ON A HANDFUL OF FIXED-LOCATION SENSORS, OFTEN WELL ABOVE THE BIRD-OCCUPIED ZONE. SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS FROM OPTIMAL CLIMATE CONDITIONS FOR THE BIRDS ARE COMMON, BUT INSTALLING A HIGHER-DENSITY GRID OF FIXED SENSORS IS NOT COST EFFECTIVE. A ROBOTIC PLATFORM, MOVING THROUGH THE FLOCK OF BIRDS AND COLLECTING DETAILED SPACIAL INFORMATION ON A WIDE RANGE OF CLIMATE PARAMETERS AT BIRD LEVEL, ENABLES ACCURATE DECISIONS TO BE MADE TO OPTIMISE THE CLIMATE IN LARGE SHEDS BEING MADE IN REAL TIME. 2. A PRELIMINARY STUDY INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY OF RUNNING A MOBILE ROBOTIC PLATFORM AMONG A FLOCK OF BROILER CHICKENS FOR AN ENTIRE 6-WEEK CYCLE. BIRD BEHAVIOUR IN RESPONSE TO THE ROBOT WAS STUDIED. 3. IN TOTAL, 1597 ROSS 308 BROILER CHICKS WERE HOUSED IN A ROOM THAT WAS SET UP TO REPLICATE A COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENT. THE ROBOT WAS DRIVEN ALONG A FIXED ROUTE THREE TIMES A DAY (MONDAY–FRIDAY) FOR THE WHOLE CYCLE UNDER MANUAL CONTROL. BEHAVIOUR WAS STUDIED USING CAMERA FOOTAGE. 4. THE BIRDS SHOWED VERY LITTLE ‘STARTLED’ BEHAVIOUR IN RESPONSE TO THE ROBOT AND WERE QUICK TO FILL THE AREA BEHIND THE ROBOT AS IT MOVED PAST. ACTIVITY LEVELS INCREASED DURING ROBOT RUNS BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN DURING WALK-THROUGH BY A HUMAN STOCKMAN. THE CHALLENGES OF OPERATING THE ROBOT CHANGED AS THE BIRDS GREW, WITH MANY INDIVIDUALS COMING INTO PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH THE FRONT OF THE ROBOT LATER IN THE CYCLE. DESPITE THIS, VERY FEW BIRDS REFUSED TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY COMPLETELY, AND MORTALITY AND PRODUCTION PARAMETERS REMAINED ACCEPTABLE THROUGHOUT. 5. THIS STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT RUNNING A MOBILE ROBOT AMONG A FLOCK OF BROILER CHICKENS IS POSSIBLE BETWEEN 3 AND 37 D IN A CYCLE AND CAUSES LIMITED DISRUPTION TO BIRD BEHAVIOUR. FUTURE WORK NEEDS TO REPEAT THIS TRIAL ON MULTIPLE FLOCKS TO SEE WHETHER RUNNING A MOBILE ROBOT AMONG THE BROILERS CAN BE ACHIEVED IN A COMMERCIAL SETTING, WITH LIMITED DISRUPTION TO BIRD BEHAVIOUR. © 2020 BRITISH POULTRY SCIENCE LTD.";"ACTIVITY; BEHAVIOUR; BROILERS; FCR; MORTALITY; ROBOT";"ANIMALS; CHICKENS; ROBOTICS; ANIMAL; CHICKEN; ROBOTICS";"BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL, BBSRC, (BB/R021589/1); INNOVATE UK, (132864)";"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY INNOVATE UK (REFERENCE: 132864) AND BBSRC (GRANT: BB/R021589/1).

THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT AMONG DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY ROSE THE MOST, AT 6.6%, AND GRAIN AND OIL ROSE THE LEAST, AT 0.3%. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF RESIDENTS' INCOME AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA, THE PRICES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS IN CHENGDU HAVE RISEN OVERALL, AND THE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ARE GREATEST IN AREAS WITH SMALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION VALUES. THE RESEARCH IN THIS ARTICLE IS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT PRICE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM UNDER THE IMPACT OF THE EPIDEMIC, AND PROVIDES DECISION-MAKING REFERENCE FOR EFFECTIVE FORMULATION OF RELEVANT POLICIES TO STABILIZE PRICES AND EASE THE PRESSURE ON RESIDENTS' LIVES. © 2021 IEEE.";"ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT PRICES; DECISION-MAKING REFERENCE; DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE; NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PNEUMONIA";"AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS; DECISION MAKING; GRAIN (AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT); AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIONS; DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES; DOMESTIC RESEARCH; GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; INCOME EFFECTS; PRICE FLUCTUATION; PRICE OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS; PRODUCT PRICE; COSTS";"";"";"SU M., ZHAO F., LI C., FENG B., ANALYSIS OF CHINA'S PRICE SITUATION AND MACRO FISCAL POLICY J, REVIEW OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, 2013, 19, PP. 9-26; CHEN Y., MA Y., MACRO-PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION: OBJECTIVES, TOOLS AND RELATED INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS J, ECONOMIC THEORY AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, 2012, 3, PP. 5-15; HUANG W., THOUGHTS ON THE APPLICATION OF COBWEB DIVERGENCE MODEL THEORY IN CHINESE AGRICULTURE J, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY, 2006, 3, PP. 28-30; ZHANG L., ZHANG H., INTERNATIONAL OIL PRICES, ALTERNATIVE FUELS, AND WORLD FOOD PRICES: AN ANALYSIS OF THE TRANSMISSION MECHANISM BASED ON THE ALTERNATIVE MODEL OF EXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCE TECHNOLOGY J, WORLD ECONOMY STUDIES, 2009, 6, PP. 13-18+25+87; DONG X., SHUAI W., ZHAO Z., AN EMPIRICAL STUDY ON THE IMPACT OF OIL PRICE CHANGES ON CHINA'S FOOD PRICES J, CHINA SOFT SCIENCE, 2014, 10, PP. 129-143; GUO X., GE D., RESEARCH ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINA'S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT PRICE J, JOURNAL OF ANHUI AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES, 37, 19, PP. 9153-9155, (2009); GU G., FANG C., ANALYSIS ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINA'S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT PRICE VOLATILITY-BASED ON THE SITUATION TRANSFER MODEL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INTERNATIONAL MARKET FACTORS J, CHINESE RURAL ECONOMY, 2010, 6, PP. 67-76; ZHOU J., ZHANG J., ANALYSIS OF THE REASONS FOR THE PRICE RISE OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS IN CHINA AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY J, JOURNAL OF JIANGXI UNIVERSITY OFFINANCE AND ECONOMICS, 2008, 4, PP. 60-63; SUN J., NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PNEUMONIA AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE REFORM J, WORLD ECONOMICS AND POLITICS, 2020, 5, PP. 71-95";"Q.

ESTABLISHMENT OF A CELL, TISSUE OR ORGAN CULTURE AND REGENERATION OF PLANTLETS UNDER IN VITRO CONDITIONS HAS OPENED UP NEW AVENUES IN THE AREA OF PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY. MICROPROPAGATION IS ONE SUCH METHOD WHERE THE PLANTS ARE GROWN UNDER IN VITRO CONDITIONS TO PROVIDE A BETTER SURVIVAL RATE AND MASS PROPAGATION IN A SHORT TIME, IT IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXPLANTS AND THEIR INITIAL GROWTH IN VITRO, FOLLOWED BY TRANSFERRING THEM ONTO THE FIELD OR IN A GREENHOUSE. THIS HAS TRIGGERED A GREAT INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND PERFORMING A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY REGARDING THE CHANGE IN PHYSIOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY UNDER INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS USEFUL BACTERIAL COMBINATIONS. IN THIS REVIEW, PLANT GROWTH PROMOTING RIZOBACTERIA (PGPR) WERE USED IN THE BIO PRIMING OF THE MICRO PROPAGATED PLANTS (BANANA), THESE PLANTS SHOWED INCREASED GROWTH OF THE ROOT LENGTH; SHOOT LENGTH, INTERNODE DIAMETER AND NUMBER OF LEAVES. ALL PARTS OF THE BANANA PLANT HAVE MEDICINAL APPLICATIONS: THE FLOWERS IN BRONCHITIS AND DYSENTERY AND ON ULCERS; COOKED FLOWERS ARE GIVEN TO DIABETICS; THE ASTRINGENT PLANT SAP IN CASES OF HYSTERIA, EPILEPSY, LEPROSY, FEVERS, HEMORRHAGES, ACUTE DYSENTERY AND DIARRHEA, AND IT IS APPLIED ON HEMORRHOIDS, INSECT AND OTHER STINGS AND BITES; YOUNG LEAVES ARE PLACED AS POULTICES ON BURNS AND OTHER SKIN AFFLICTIONS; THE ASTRINGENT ASHES OF THE UNRIPE PEEL AND OF THE LEAVES ARE TAKEN IN DYSENTERY AND DIARRHEA AND USED FOR TREATING MALIGNANT ULCERS; THE ROOTS ARE ADMINISTERED IN DIGESTIVE DISORDERS, DYSENTERY AND OTHER AILMENTS; BANANA SEED MUCILAGE IS GIVEN IN CASES OF DIARRHEA IN INDIA. THE CHANGES IN PROTEIN EXPRESSION AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI WERE EVALUATED WHICH LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE BIO HARDENED PLANTS SHOWED HIGH PROTEIN CONTENT BUT HAD THE SIMILAR GENETIC CONTENT WHEN COMPARED AGAINST THE CONTROL PLANTS. THUS INCREASE IN THE PROTEIN CONTENT ENHANCES THESE MEDICINAL QUALITIES OF BANANA PLANT.

PLF ALLOWS REAL-TIME MANAGEMENT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA (DATA FROM THE ANIMALS, THEIR FEED CONSUMPTION, THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE BARN, ETC.). THESE DATA SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING BY THE FARMER (E.G. MANAGEMENT OF VENTILATION AND HEATING). PLF USES MODERN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES TO EXCHANGE, TRANSFORM AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THE FARMER. PLF CAN ALSO INVOLVE THE USE OF AUTOMATIC SYSTEMS AND ROBOTS WHICH RELIEVE THE FARMER OF CERTAIN TEDIOUS TASKS. SOON, THE FARMER WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE PRODUCTION, HEALTH, BEHAVIOUR AND WELFARE PARAMETERS OF THE FLOCK IN REAL TIME. A MAJOR ISSUE IS TO LEARN FROM THE MULTIPLE DATA GENERATED AND UTILISE IT TO CREATE AND DEVELOP APPROPRIATE LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR THE FARMER. SMARTPHONE APPLICATIONS USED OUTSIDE THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR WILL BE PRESENTED AS EXAMPLES OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO THE POULTRY SECTOR. THIS PROSPECT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY NEW APPROACHES FOR THE FUTURE OF THE POULTRY SECTOR. THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. THIS REVOLUTION WILL ENCOURAGE AND FACILITATE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PARTIES (PRODUCT TRACEABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AMONG STAKEHOLDERS). PLF TECHNOLOGIES GENERATE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA, WITH VARIOUS FORMATS AND SOURCES. THE CHALLENGES ARE TO SHARE THESE DATA BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS AND IMPROVE THE STATISTICAL PROCESSING OF BIG DATA TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP NEW MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR THE FARMERS. © 2017 EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON PRECISION LIVESTOCK FARMING.

FURTHERMORE, WE USED THE ONE-AXIS MOMENTUM WHEEL MECHANISM IN THE JUMPING ROBOT FOR MAKING THE COMPACT BALANCE CONTROL MECHANISM THAT CAN CONTROL THE BODY ANGLE OF THE ROBOT. THROUGH THE EXPERIMENT, THE CONVENTIONAL JUMPING ROBOT USES THE INERTIAL TAIL TO ADJUST THE BODY ANGLE IN THE AIR FOR STABLE LANDING AND JUMPING. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF AN INERTIAL TAIL, IT HAS A LARGE VOLUME AND HAS A DISADVANTAGE IN THAT STABILITY IS HIGHLY REDUCED WHEN IT COLLIDES WITH OBSTACLES DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE INERTIAL TAIL. MOREOVER, WE PERFORMED A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS, SIMULATION, AND EXPERIMENT TO VERIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MOMENTUM WHEEL MECHANISM, AND WE CONFIRMED THAT THE PASSIVE HALLUX STRUCTURE CONTRIBUTED TO THE JUMPING STABILITY.

AN EFFECTIVE JUMP IS PREDICATED ON THE NEED TO MAINTAIN DYNAMIC STABILITY THROUGH THE ACCELERATION PHASE. THE PRESENT STUDY CONCERNS UNDERSTANDING HOW BIRDS RETAIN CONTROL OF BODY ATTITUDE AND TRAJECTORY DURING TAKE-OFF. CURSORY OBSERVATION SUGGESTS THAT STABILITY IS ACHIEVED WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE COST. HOWEVER, ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM SHOWS THAT THE STABILITY MARGINS DURING JUMPING ARE ACTUALLY VERY SMALL AND THAT STABILITY CONSIDERATIONS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE JUMPING KINEMATICS. WE USE THEORETICAL MODELS TO UNDERSTAND STABILITY IN PREHENSILE TAKEOFF (FROM A PERCH) AND ALSO IN NON-PREHENSILE TAKE-OFF (FROM THE GROUND). THE PRIMARY INSTABILITY IS TIPPING, DEFINED AS ROTATION OF THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY ABOUT THE GROUND CONTACT POINT. TIPPING OCCURS WHEN THE CENTRE OF PRESSURE FALLS OUTSIDE THE FUNCTIONAL FOOT. A CONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF GRAPHICAL TIPPING STABILITY MARGINS FOR BOTH CENTRE OF GRAVITY LOCATION AND ACCELERATION ANGLE. WE SHOW THAT THE NOSE-UP ANGULAR ACCELERATION EXTENDS STABILITY BOUNDS FORWARD AND IS HENCE HELPFUL IN ACHIEVING SHALLOW TAKE-OFFS. THE STABILITY MARGINS ARE USED TO INTERROGATE SIMULATED TAKEOFFS OF REAL BIRDS USING PUBLISHED EXPERIMENTAL KINEMATIC DATA FROM A GUINEA FOWL (GROUND TAKE-OFF) AND A DIAMOND DOVE (PERCH TAKE-OFF). FOR THE GUINEA FOWL, THE INITIAL PART OF THE JUMP IS STABLE; HOWEVER, SIMULATIONS EXHIBIT A STUTTERING INSTABILITY NOT OBSERVED EXPERIMENTALLY THAT IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF COMPLIANCE IN THE IDEALIZED JOINTS. THE DIAMOND DOVE MODEL CONFIRMS THAT THE FOOT PROVIDES AN ACTIVE TORQUE REACTION DURING TAKE-OFF, EXTENDING THE RANGE OF STABLE JUMP ANGLES BY AROUND 45 DEGREES.";"JUMPING; FLIGHT STABILITY; TAKE-OFF; ANIMAL FLIGHT; AERODYNAMICS; JUMPING ROBOTS";"WALKING; LEG; PERFORMANCE; KINEMATICS; MECHANICS; FORCES; FLIGHT; MODEL; ROBOT; LOCOMOTION";NA;NA;"AGUILAR J, 2015, NAT PHYS, V12;AGUILAR J, 2012, PHYS REV LETT, V109, DOI 10.1103/PHYSREVLETT.109.174301;ALEXANDER RM, 1995, PHILOS T R SOC B, V347, P235, DOI 10.1098/RSTB.1995.0024;ANDRADA E, 2015, SCI REP-UK, V5, DOI 10.1038/SREP13636;ANDRADA E, 2014, P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI, V281, DOI 10.1098/RSPB.2014.1405;ARMOUR R, 2007, BIOINSPIR BIOMIM, V2, PS65, DOI 10.1088/1748-3182/2/3/S01;BACKUS SB, 2015, ROY SOC OPEN SCI, V2, DOI 10.1098/RSOS.140350;BENNETCLARK HC, 1967, J EXP BIOL, V47, P59;BOBBERT MF, 1996, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V28, P1402, DOI 10.1097/00005768-199611000-00009;BOBBERT MF, 2001, J EXP BIOL, V204, P533;BONSER RHC, 1996, J EXP BIOL, V199, P435;COFER D, 2010, J EXP BIOL, V213, P3378, DOI 10.1242/JEB.046367;DALLALI H., 2012, MODELLING DYNAMICS S;DEMES B, 1996, J HUM EVOL, V31, P367, DOI 10.1006/JHEV.1996.0066;DIAL KP, 1993, J EXP BIOL, V176, P31;EARLS KD, 2000, J EXP BIOL, V203, P725;ESSNER RL, 2002, J EXP BIOL, V205, P2469;GATESY SM, 1993, J EXP BIOL, V176, P55;GATESY SM, 1991, J ZOOL, V224, P127, DOI 10.1111/J.1469-7998.1991.TB04794.X;GILCHRIST LA, 1996, J BIOMECH, V29, P795, DOI 10.1016/0021-9290(95)00141-7;GOSWAMI A, 1999, ICRA '99: IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION, VOLS 1-4, PROCEEDINGS, P47, DOI 10.1109/ROBOT.1999.769929;GUNTHER M.M., 1991, ZEITSCHRIFT FUER MORPHOLOGIE UND ANTHROPOLOGIE, V78, P341;GVIRSMAN O, 2016, PEERJ, V4, DOI 10.7717/PEERJ.2481;HALDANE DW, 2016, SCI ROBOT, V1, DOI 10.1126/SCIROBOTICS.AAG2048;HALE E., 2000, PROCEEDINGS 2000 ICRA.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO MEASURE PEDICLE SCREW PLACEMENT ACCURACY USING A NOVEL AUTOMATED MEASUREMENT SYSTEM THAT DIRECTLY COMPARES THE IMPLANTED SCREW LOCATION TO THE PLANNED TARGET IN ALL THREE ANATOMICAL VIEWS. PREOPERATIVE CT SCANS WERE USED TO PLAN THE SCREW TRAJECTORIES IN 122 PATIENTS ACROSS FOUR SURGICAL CENTERS. POSTOPERATIVE SCANS WERE FUSED TO THE PREOPERATIVE PLAN TO QUANTIFY PLACEMENT ACCURACY USING AN AUTOMATED MEASUREMENT ALGORITHM. THE MEAN MEDIAL-LATERAL AND SUPERIOR-INFERIOR DEVIATIONS IN THE PEDICLE REGION FOR 500 SCREWS WERE 1.75 & PLUSMN; 1.36 MM AND 1.52 & PLUSMN; 1.26 MM, RESPECTIVELY.

IN THIS CONTEXT, LORAWAN IS AN ACCURATE NETWORK TOPOLOGY BASED ON A WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY CALLED LORA THAT IS CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING SMALL DATA RATES AT A LONG RANGE, USING LOW-POWERED DEVICES, MAKING IT IDEAL FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CLIMATE VARIABLES, SUCH AS TEMPERATURE AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY. APPLYING THIS ARCHITECTURE TO AGRICULTURE BUILDINGS CAN BE VERY USEFUL TO GUARANTEE INDOOR THERMAL COMFORT CONDITIONS. IN THIS STUDY, THIS TECHNOLOGY IS APPLIED TO A PASSIVE SOLAR SYSTEM COMPOSED BY A HIGH THERMAL INERTIA WALL, DEFINED AS TROMBE WALL, WITH AIR VENTS PROVIDED IN THE MASSIVE WALL TO IMPROVE HEAT TRANSFER BY AIR CONVECTION, AND AN EXTERNAL SHADING DEVICE TO AVOID OVERHEATING DURING SUMMER AND HEAT LOSSES DURING WINTER.

HOWEVER, BROILERS' RESPONSE TOWARD AUTOMATED SYSTEMS REMAINS UNCLEAR. THE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE AVOIDANCE DISTANCE (AD) AND THE FLEEING SPEED (FS) OF 4-8 WEEKS OLD BROILERS TOWARD TWO AERIAL SYSTEMS, A RAIL WITH A DUMMY ARM AND A DRONE, OPERATED AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS (0.2-1.2 M/S), AND HEIGHTS (0.3-1.8 M) IN A COMMERCIAL BROILER HOUSE. THE BROILER AD TO A HUMAN ASSESSOR WAS ALSO DETERMINED FOR COMPARISON. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OVERALL MEAN AND STANDARD ERROR (SE) OF BROILER AD WERE 63 +/- 3 CM FOR THE ASSESSOR, 58 +/- 1 CM FOR THE RAIL, AND 85 +/- 1 CM FOR THE DRONE. AS BIRD AGE INCREASED FROM WEEK 4 TO WEEK 8, BROILER AD REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 82 TO 45 CM FOR THE RAIL BUT SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOR THE DRONE. AS THE OPERATIONAL SPEED INCREASED, BROILER AD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM 54 CM (0.2 M/S) TO 62 CM (0.4 M/S) FOR THE RAIL, AND FROM 81 CM (0.4 M/S) TO 89 CM (1.2 M/S) FOR THE DRONE. AS THE OPERATIONAL HEIGHT INCREASED, BROILER AD INCREASED FROM 54 CM (0.3 M) TO 57 CM (1.5 M) FOR THE RAIL AND 81 CM (1.2 M) TO 88 CM (1.8 M) FOR THE DRONE. OVERALL MEAN AND SE OF BROILER FS WERE 0.21 +/- 0.01 M/S FOR THE RAIL AND 0.65 +/- 0.01 M/S FOR THE DRONE.

THIS IS A CEILING-SUSPENDED ROBOT EQUIPPED WITH SEVERAL SENSORS AND CAMERAS THAT CONTINUOUSLY COLLECT DATA WHILE MOVING THROUGH THE BARN.

ABOUT 40-50% OF ALL RECORDS COLLECTED WITH THE EARLY VERSION OF THE FAS HAD TO BE SORTED OUT. THE NEWER VERSION OF FAS PROVIDED CLEANER DATA, ALTHOUGH STILL ABOUT 10-20% OF THE DATA HAD TO BE REMOVED. OUR STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT WHERE SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEMS MEET A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT, A THOROUGH AND CRITICAL REVIEW OF DATA COMPLETENESS AND QUALITY IS CRUCIAL TO AVOID MISINTERPRETATION.

HOWEVER, KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF LED LIGHTS ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE WAS STILL NOT CLEAR. THIS EXPERIMENT HYPOTHESIZES THAT SHORT-WAVELENGTH LIGHT DISTURBS CHICKENS??? EATING RHYTHM AND LEADS TO THE WRONG TIME TO EAT, RESULTING IN METABOLIC SYNDROME. ???MEIHUANG??? BROILERS WERE HOUSED IN MONOCHROMATIC LED BLUE LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT, YELLOW LIGHT, RED LIGHT, OR WHITE LIGHT WITH A VERY LOW DOSE (15 LX). MULTIPLY PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS WERE MEASURED AND THE 24-H EATING BEHAVIOR WAS DETERMINED. THE EFFECTS OF LED LIGHT ON PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS AND BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE SHOWED A WAVELENGTH-DEPENDENT MANNER. SHORT-WAVELENGTH LIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THE LEVEL OF TOTAL TRIGLYCERIDES AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL BUT INCREASED TRIIODOTHYRONINE CONCENTRATION. INVERSELY, LONG-WAVELENGTH LIGHT INCREASED THE TRIGLYCERIDES AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL AND REDUCED THE LEVEL OF TRIIODOTHYRONINE. FURTHER, IT WAS FOUND THAT SHORT-WAVELENGTH LIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY BOOSTED BODY WEIGHT COMPARED WITH LONG-WAVELENGTH LIGHT, DESPITE EQUIVALENT LEVELS OF FOOD INTAKE. SHORT-WAVELENGTH LIGHT-INDUCED 23.4% AND 14.1% OF FOOD CONSUMPTION DURING SUBJECTIVE NIGHTS, BUT LONG-WAVELENGTH LIGHT DID NOT. THESE RESULTS IMPLY THAT WHEN CHICKENS EAT MATTERS, NOT JUST WHAT THEY EAT. THUS, LOW AS 15 LX OF BLUE LIGHT EXPOSURE DURING THE TYPICAL DARK PERIOD IS SUFFICIENT TO LEAD AN INDIVIDUAL TO EAT AT THE ???WRONG??? TIME, CAUSING METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION.

COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES OFFER EXCITING POTENTIAL FOR ROUTINE AND AUTOMATED ASSESSMENT OF BROILER WELFARE, PROVIDING AN OBJECTIVE AND BIOSECURE ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT MORE SUBJECTIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING METHODS. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPUTER VISION SOLUTIONS FOR ASSESSING BROILER WELFARE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THE TRANSITION TO FULLY AUTOMATED MONITORING IN A COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENT. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS FOR DETECTION AND RESOURCE USE MONITORING OF BROILERS HOUSED IN BOTH EXPERIMENTAL AND COMMERCIAL SETTINGS, WHILE ALSO ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL FOR SCALABILITY AND RESOURCE-EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH SOLUTIONS. THIS STUDY USED A COMBINATION OF DETECTION AND RESOURCE USE MONITORING METHODS, WHERE BROILERS WERE FIRST DETECTED USING MASK R-CNN AND WERE THEN ASSIGNED TO A SPECIFIC RESOURCE ZONE USING ZONE-BASED CLASSIFIERS. THREE DETECTION MODELS WERE PROPOSED USING DIFFERENT ANNOTATION DATASETS: MODEL A WITH ANNOTATED BROILERS FROM A RESEARCH FACILITY, MODEL B WITH ANNOTATED BROILERS FROM A COMMERCIAL FARM, AND MODEL A+B WHERE ANNOTATIONS FROM BOTH ENVIRONMENTS WERE COMBINED. THE ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED FOR INDIVIDUAL BROILER DETECTION PERFORMED WELL FOR BOTH THE RESEARCH FACILITY (MODEL A, F-1 SCORE > 0.99) AND COMMERCIAL FARM (MODEL A+B, F-1 SCORE > 0.83) TEST DATA WITH AN INTERSECTION OVER UNION OF 0.75. THE SUBSEQUENT MONITORING OF RESOURCE USE AT THE COMMERCIAL FARM USING MODEL A+B FOR BROILER DETECTION, ALSO PERFORMED VERY WELL FOR THE FEEDERS, BALE AND PERCH (F-1 SCORE > 0.93), BUT NOT FOR THE DRINKERS (F-1 SCORE = 0.28), WHICH WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY OUR EVALUATION METHOD.

BROILERS' BEHAVIOR IN THE BREEDING ENVIRONMENT CAN BE TRACKED TO ANALYZE THEIR BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH STATUS FURTHER. AN IMPROVED YOLOV3 (YOU ONLY LOOK ONCE V3) ALGORITHM WAS USED AS THE DETECTOR OF THE DEEP SORT (SIMPLE ONLINE AND REALTIME TRACKING) ALGORITHM TO REALIZE THE MULTIPLE OBJECT TRACKING OF YELLOW FEATHER BROILERS IN THE FLAT BREEDING CHAMBER, WHICH REPLACED THE BACKBONE OF YOLOV3 WITH MOBILENETV2 TO IMPROVE THE INFERENCE SPEED OF THE DETECTION MODULE. THE DRSN (DEEP RESIDUAL SHRINKAGE NETWORK) WAS INTEGRATED WITH MOBILENETV2 TO ENHANCE THE FEATURE EXTRACTION CAPABILITY OF THE NETWORK. MOREOVER, IN VIEW OF THE SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL SIZE OF THE YELLOW FEATHER BROILER, THE FEATURE FUSION NETWORK WAS ALSO REDESIGNED BY COMBINING IT WITH THE ATTENTION MECHANISM TO ENABLE THE ADAPTIVE LEARNING OF THE OBJECTS' MULTI-SCALE FEATURES. COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL YOLOV3, IMPROVED YOLOV3 ACHIEVES 93.2% MAP (MEAN AVERAGE PRECISION) AND 29 FPS (FRAMES PER SECOND), REPRESENTING HIGH-PRECISION REAL-TIME DETECTION PERFORMANCE. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE MOTA (MULTIPLE OBJECT TRACKING ACCURACY) INCREASES FROM 51% TO 54%, THE IDSW (IDENTITY SWITCH) DECREASES BY 62.2% COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL YOLOV3-BASED OBJECTIVE DETECTORS.

AND COSTS THE BROILER INDUSTRY MORE THAN 14 BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR GLOBALLY. DIFFERENT CHICKEN EIME-RIA SPECIES VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN PATHOGENICITY AND VIRU-LENCE, SO THE CLASSIFICATION OF DIFFERENT CHICKEN EIMERIA SPECIES IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SUR-VEY AND RELATED PREVENTION AND CONTROL. THE MICROSCOPIC MORPHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION FOR THEIR CLASSIFICATION WAS WIDELY USED IN CLINICAL APPLICATIONS, BUT IT IS A TIME-CON-SUMING TASK AND NEEDS EXPERTISE. TO INCREASE THE CLASSIFI-CATION EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY, A NOVEL MODEL INTEGRATING TRANSFORMER AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN), NAMED RESIDUAL-TRANSFORMER-FINE-GRAINED (RESTFG), WAS PROPOSED AND EVALUATED FOR FINE-GRAINED CLASSIFICATION OF MICROSCOPIC IMAGES OF SEVEN CHICKEN EIMERIA SPECIES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT RESTFG ACHIEVED THE BEST PER-FORMANCE WITH HIGH ACCURACY AND LOW COST COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL MODELS. SPECIFICALLY, THE PARAMETERS, INFERENCE SPEED AND OVERALL ACCURACY OF RESTFG ARE 1.95M, 256 FPS AND 96.9%, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE 10.9 TIMES LIGHTER, 1.5 TIMES FASTER AND 2.7% HIGHER IN ACCURACY THAN THE BENCHMARK MODEL. IN ADDITION, RESTFG SHOWED BETTER PERFORMANCE ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE MORE VIRULENT SPECIES. THE RESULTS OF ABLATION EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT CNN OR TRANSFORMER ALONE HAD MODEL ACCURACIES OF ONLY 89.8% AND 87.0%, WHICH PROVED THAT THE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF RESTFG WAS BENEFIT FROM THE COMPLEMENTARY EFFECT OF CNN'S LOCAL FEATURE EXTRACTION AND TRANSFORMER'S GLOBAL RECEPTIVE FIELD. THIS STUDY INVENTED A RELIABLE, LOW-COST, AND PROMISING DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR THE AUTOMATIC FINE-GRAIN CLASSIFICATION OF CHICKEN EIMERIA SPECIES, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY BE EMBEDDED IN MICROSCOPIC DEVICES TO IMPROVE THE WORK EFFICIENCY OF RESEARCHERS AND EXTENDED TO OTHER PARASITE OVA, AND APPLIED TO OTHER AGRICULTURAL TASKS AS A BACKBONE.";"CHICKEN EIMERIA CLASSIFICATION; DEEP LEARNING; CONVOLUTIONAL AND TRANSFORMER STRUCTURE; COMPLEMENTARY EFFECT";"IDENTIFICATION; COCCIDIOSIS; DIAGNOSIS";"KEY R&D PROGRAM OF ZHEJIANG PROVINCE [2021C02026]; AGRICULTURE RESEARCH SYSTEM OF CHINA [CARS -40]";"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE KEY R&D PROGRAM OF ZHEJIANG PROVINCE (2021C02026) AND THE AGRICULTURE RESEARCH SYSTEM OF CHINA (CARS -40) .";"ABADE A, 2022, BIOSYST ENG, V213, P39, DOI 10.1016/J.BIOSYSTEMSENG.2021.11.016;ABDALLA MAE, 2017, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P1517, DOI 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037124;ABEBE E., 2018, ABYSSINIA J SCI TECHNOL, V3, P1;ABNAR S, 2020, 58TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (ACL 2020), P4190;ADAMS DS, 2022, VET PARASITOL, V301, DOI 10.1016/J.VETPAR.2021.109634;BLAKE DP, 2020, VET RES, V51, DOI 10.1186/S13567-020-00837-2;BUTPLOY N, 2021, J PARASITOL RES, V2021, DOI 10.1155/2021/6648038;CAO YUNHE CAO YUNHE, 2013, ANIMAL FRONTIERS, V3, P48, DOI 10.2527/AF.2013-0024;CARION NICOLAS, 2020, COMPUTER VISION - ECCV 2020. 16TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE.

BMD RECOVERY OFFERS AN INCREASED QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE WITH SCI BY REDUCING THEIR RISK OF FRACTURES. THE STANDING SYSTEM DEVELOPED COMPRISES AN INSTRUMENTED FRAME EQUIPPED WITH FORCE PLATES AND LOAD CELLS, A MOTION CAPTURE SYSTEM, AND A PURPOSE BUILT 16-CHANNEL FES UNIT. THIS SYSTEM CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY RECORD AND PROCESS A WIDE RANGE OF BIOMECHANICAL DATA TO PRODUCE MUSCLE STIMULATION WHICH ENABLES USERS WITH SCI TO SAFELY STAND AND EXERCISE. AN EXERGAME PROVIDES VISUAL FEEDBACK TO THE USER TO ASSIST WITH UPPER-BODY POSTURE CONTROL DURING EXERCISING. TO VALIDATE THE SYSTEM AN ALTERNATE WEIGHT-SHIFT EXERCISE WAS USED; 3 PARTICIPANTS WITH COMPLETE SCI EXERCISED IN THE SYSTEM FOR 1 HOUR TWICE-WEEKLY FOR 6 MONTHS. WE OBSERVED GROUND REACTION FORCES OVER 70% OF THE FULL BODY-WEIGHT DISTRIBUTED TO THE SUPPORTING LEG AT EACH EXERCISING CYCLE. EXERCISE PERFORMANCE IMPROVED FOR EACH PARTICIPANT BY AN INCREASE OF 13.88 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF BODY-WEIGHT IN THE LOADING OF THE SUPPORTING LEG DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD. IMPORTANTLY, THE OBSERVED GROUND REACTION FORCES ARE OF HIGHER MAGNITUDE THAN OTHER STUDIES WHICH REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS ON BMD. THIS NOVEL INSTRUMENTATION AIMS TO INVESTIGATE WEIGHT BEARING STANDING THERAPIES AIMED AT DETERMINING THE BIOMECHANICS OF LOWER LIMB JOINT FORCE ACTIONS AND POSTURAL KINEMATICS.";NA;"FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; BONE-DENSITY; POSTURE; PATIENT; SYSTEM";"ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL [EP/L02019X/1]; EPSRC [EP/L02019X/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI";"THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK DR.
